It functions by inhibiting the gastric proton pump, making it effective in treating conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcers.  \n\nA key pharmacological characteristic of omeprazole is its interaction with the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, particularly **CYP2C19**. It acts as an inhibitor of this enzyme, which can lead to clinically significant drug-drug interactions. Notably, omeprazole competes with **clopidogrel** for CYP2C19 metabolism, potentially reducing clopidogrel's antiplatelet effectiveness when taken concurrently. This interaction is particularly relevant for patients on dual antiplatelet therapy following cardiovascular events.  \n\nAdditionally, omeprazole interacts with **St. John's Wort**, an herbal supplement known to induce CYP enzymes. This interaction may alter omeprazole's pharmacokinetics, potentially reducing its efficacy.  \n\nIn summary, omeprazole is an effective acid-suppressing medication but requires careful consideration of its metabolic interactions, particularly with CYP2C19 substrates like clopidogrel and enzyme inducers like St. John's Wort. Monitoring and dose adjustments may be necessary to avoid therapeutic failure or adverse effects.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167539, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 262, "prompt_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 466, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 76}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
