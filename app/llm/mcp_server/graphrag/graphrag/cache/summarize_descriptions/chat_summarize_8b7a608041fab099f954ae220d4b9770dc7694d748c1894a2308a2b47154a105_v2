This condition is attributed to anxiety or stress triggered by the presence of medical professionals, often referred to as the \"white coat effect.\" While these patients may appear hypertensive during clinical measurements, their blood pressure typically remains within normal ranges in everyday settings, such as at home or during ambulatory monitoring.  \n\nWhite coat hypertension is distinct from chronic hypertension, as it does not necessarily indicate an underlying cardiovascular risk. However, it may still warrant monitoring, as some studies suggest it could be a precursor to sustained high blood pressure in certain individuals. Accurate diagnosis often involves comparing clinical readings with out-of-office measurements, such as home blood pressure monitoring or 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure assessments, to rule out true hypertension.  \n\nIn summary, white coat hypertension is characterized by transient blood pressure spikes in medical environments due to situational anxiety, while normal readings persist elsewhere. Proper evaluation is essential to differentiate it from chronic hypertension and guide appropriate management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167071, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 218, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 394, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 112}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
