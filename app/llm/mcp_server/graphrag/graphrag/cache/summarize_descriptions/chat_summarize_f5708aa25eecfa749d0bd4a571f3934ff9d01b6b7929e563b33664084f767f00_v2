It is a key component in several herbal formulations, including 理气活血滴丸 (Liqi Huoxue Diwan) and 正心泰胶囊 (Zhengxin Tai Jiaonang), where it contributes to活血化瘀 (promoting blood circulation and resolving blood stasis) and通络 (dredging collaterals or improving meridian flow) effects.  \n\nAs a medicinal herb,川芎 is primarily valued for its ability to enhance blood flow, alleviate stagnation, and support cardiovascular health. Its inclusion in multiple formulations underscores its versatility in addressing conditions related to blood stasis and meridian blockages. The herb is commonly employed in clinical practice to manage pain, menstrual disorders, and circulatory deficiencies, making it a staple in traditional Chinese medicine for活血化瘀 therapies.  \n\nBy integrating its functions across different preparations,川芎 demonstrates consistent efficacy in both活血 (activating blood) and通络 (unblocking meridians) applications, reinforcing its role as a fundamental herb in circulatory and meridian-related treatments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167231, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 228, "prompt_tokens": 171, "total_tokens": 399, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 107}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
