It functions similarly to niacin but exhibits longer-lasting and stronger anti-lipolytic effects. Acipimox is primarily used to lower triglyceride and cholesterol levels in the blood while also improving glucose tolerance. Its pharmacological properties make it a valuable therapeutic agent for managing dyslipidemia and related metabolic conditions.  \n\nBy inhibiting lipolysis, Acipimox reduces the release of free fatty acids, which contributes to its lipid-lowering effects. This mechanism distinguishes it from other niacin derivatives, offering enhanced efficacy and duration of action. The drug is well-recognized for its dual benefits in improving both lipid profiles and glucose metabolism, making it particularly useful in patients with metabolic disorders.  \n\nIn summary, Acipimox is a potent, long-acting niacin derivative that effectively addresses elevated triglycerides, cholesterol, and impaired glucose tolerance, providing a comprehensive approach to metabolic management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517970, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 417, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 137}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
