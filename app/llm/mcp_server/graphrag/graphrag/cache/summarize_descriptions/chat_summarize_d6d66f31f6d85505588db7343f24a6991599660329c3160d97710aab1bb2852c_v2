Their work spans multiple aspects of hypertension, including its association with alcohol consumption in Chinese adults, its links to chronic kidney disease, and the phenomena of white-coat and masked hypertension. Additionally, LI Y has contributed to studies on nocturnal hypertension and blood pressure management, as well as the use of cognitive behavioral therapy for hypertension treatment. They have also explored the role of home blood pressure monitoring in managing the condition. Beyond hypertension, LI Y has been involved in research on **Xuezhitong** for treating hypertriglyceridemia, demonstrating a multidisciplinary approach to cardiovascular and metabolic health. Their body of work reflects expertise in both clinical and behavioral interventions for hypertension and associated disorders.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559539, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 154, "prompt_tokens": 253, "total_tokens": 407, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 189}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
