It facilitates the uptake of drugs and other organic anions into hepatocytes, influencing their pharmacokinetics and therapeutic effects. OATP1B1 is primarily expressed in the liver, where it mediates the transport of substrates such as statins, impacting their absorption and metabolism.  \n\nAdditionally, OATP1B1 activity can be inhibited by certain drugs, such as cyclosporine (环孢素), which may alter the pharmacokinetics of co-administered medications that rely on this transporter. The protein's function is essential for drug disposition, and its inhibition or genetic variability can lead to changes in drug efficacy and toxicity.  \n\nIn summary, OATP1B1 is a key hepatic transporter involved in drug uptake, particularly for statins, and its activity can be modulated by inhibitors like cyclosporine, affecting overall drug metabolism and clinical outcomes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167509, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 437, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 157}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
