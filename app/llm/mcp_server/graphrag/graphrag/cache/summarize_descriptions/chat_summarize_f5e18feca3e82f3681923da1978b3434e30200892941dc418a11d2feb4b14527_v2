It is often grouped with pheochromocytoma (PCC) under the collective term **PPGL (pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma)**. Paragangliomas are known to cause hypertension due to their neuroendocrine activity and are frequently associated with underlying genetic mutations. These tumors can exhibit both functional and non-functional characteristics, depending on their location and hormone secretion. The association with genetic predispositions highlights the importance of molecular testing in diagnosis and management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559517, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 116, "prompt_tokens": 169, "total_tokens": 285, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 105}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
