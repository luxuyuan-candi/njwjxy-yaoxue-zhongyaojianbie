Research indicates that its risk is heightened by factors such as **hypertension** and **blood pressure variability**, suggesting a link between cardiovascular health and cognitive function. Additionally, cognitive impairment is recognized as a **symptom of late-onset depression** in elderly patients, where it may also serve as a potential indicator of an elevated **risk for dementia**.
