However, they have notable effects on lipid metabolism, which may impact patients with preexisting lipid abnormalities. These drugs can lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, making them unsuitable for individuals with isolated low HDL and hypertension. Additionally, β 受体阻滞剂 may cause a slight increase in overall lipid levels, potentially exacerbating conditions like hyperlipidemia and reducing treatment efficacy in affected patients.  \n\nWhen prescribing β 受体阻滞剂, healthcare providers should consider the patient's lipid profile, as the medication could worsen lipid-related health issues. While effective for cardiovascular management, its dual impact on HDL reduction and potential lipid elevation necessitates careful evaluation, particularly in patients with concurrent hypertension and dyslipidemia.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167128, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 361, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 135}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
