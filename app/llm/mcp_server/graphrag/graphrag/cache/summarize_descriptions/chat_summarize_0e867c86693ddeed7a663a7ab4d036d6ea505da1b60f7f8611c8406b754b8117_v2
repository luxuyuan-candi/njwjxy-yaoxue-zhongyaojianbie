In traditional Chinese medicine, it is valued for its cooling and diuretic properties, often used to promote hydration, reduce internal heat, and support detoxification. At the same time, DONGGUA is a common ingredient in various dinner recipes, particularly in Asian cuisines, where it is prized for its mild flavor and ability to absorb the tastes of accompanying ingredients. It is frequently used in soups, stir-fries, and stews, contributing a refreshing and light texture to dishes.  \n\nThus, DONGGUA serves dual purposes: as a therapeutic herb in traditional medicine and as a nutritious, adaptable vegetable in everyday cooking.
