Core symptoms often include emotional, physical, and cognitive disturbances such as fatigue, sleep disruptions, impaired social functioning, and, in severe cases, suicidal thoughts. The condition is classified into mild, moderate, and severe levels based on diagnostic criteria, which also account for additional symptoms like changes in appetite, concentration difficulties, and feelings of worthlessness.  \n\nDepression varies across age, gender, and cultural backgrounds, and its presentation may differ among individuals. While no single diagnostic method exists, standardized clinical evaluation is essential to exclude other medical conditions and confirm the diagnosis. Early diagnosis and evidence-based treatment—including medication, psychotherapy, and lifestyle management—are critical to controlling symptoms and reducing relapse rates.  \n\nDespite its prevalence, depression remains undertreated, with fewer than 10% of affected individuals receiving adequate care in many countries. It is particularly common among patients with physical illnesses, with prevalence rates ranging from 9% to 33%, depending on the underlying condition. Effective treatment of depression not only alleviates mental health symptoms but can also improve physical health outcomes.  \n\nIn summary, depression is a complex, multifaceted disorder requiring comprehensive assessment and tailored interventions to address its wide-ranging impact on emotional well-being, daily functioning, and overall health.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517989, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 271, "prompt_tokens": 411, "total_tokens": 682, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 347}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
