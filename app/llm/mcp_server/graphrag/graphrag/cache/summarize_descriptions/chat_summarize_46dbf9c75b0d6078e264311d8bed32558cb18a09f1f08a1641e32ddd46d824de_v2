It presents with a range of emotional, physical, and cognitive symptoms, including fatigue, sleep disturbances, and, in severe cases, suicidal thoughts. The condition is classified into mild, moderate, and severe levels based on symptom count and functional impairment.  \n\nDepression varies across age, gender, and cultural backgrounds and lacks specific diagnostic methods, requiring clinical evaluation and the exclusion of other medical conditions for accurate diagnosis. Early diagnosis and standardized treatment are crucial to control symptoms and reduce relapse rates. Despite its prevalence, depression has low treatment rates, affecting 10% or fewer patients in many countries. It is also highly common among individuals with physical illnesses, with prevalence rates ranging from 9% to 33%, depending on the underlying condition.
