Classified as a food-medicine substance, it is particularly recommended for addressing specific types of hyperlipidemia, including cases characterized by phlegm-turbidity obstruction (痰浊内阻型), phlegm-stasis mutual binding (痰瘀互结型), qi deficiency and blood stasis (气虚血瘀型), and spleen deficiency with dampness excess (脾虚湿盛型). Its dual role as a dietary and therapeutic ingredient highlights its significance in promoting health and managing lipid-related conditions within traditional Chinese medical frameworks.  \n\nThe bean's medicinal applications are rooted in its purported ability to regulate metabolic imbalances, particularly those involving dampness and phlegm, while its culinary use underscores its versatility as a nutritious food.
