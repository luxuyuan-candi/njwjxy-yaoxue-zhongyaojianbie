The journal covers a broad spectrum of hypertension research, including studies on Mendelian forms of low-renin hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension in the young, and pediatric hypertension characteristics in specific populations such as China. It also features meta-analyses on emerging topics like telemonitoring for blood pressure management. Additionally, J HYPERTENS has published clinical studies evaluating therapeutic interventions, such as the efficacy and safety of sacubitril/valsartan as an add-on to amlodipine in Asian patients with systolic hypertension (2017). The journal serves as a key platform for disseminating cutting-edge research on blood pressure management and advancing the understanding of hypertension across diverse patient populations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559553, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 303, "total_tokens": 474, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 239}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
