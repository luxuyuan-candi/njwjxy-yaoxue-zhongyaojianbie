It is prevalent among middle-aged and elderly individuals, as well as those with obesity, unhealthy diets, or a family history of hypertension or high cholesterol. The condition is a type of hyperlipidemia and can be classified as primary (genetic) or secondary (caused by underlying diseases or medications).  \n\nHigh cholesterol is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and stroke. Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is particularly harmful, contributing to arterial hardening and plaque buildup, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. The condition often coexists with hypertension, further increasing cardiovascular risks.  \n\nWhile high cholesterol is frequently linked to lifestyle factors such as poor diet and lack of exercise, genetic predisposition also plays a significant role. Management typically involves dietary modifications, increased physical activity, and, when necessary, medication to lower lipid levels and reduce the risk of severe complications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517922, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 220, "prompt_tokens": 395, "total_tokens": 615, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 331}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
