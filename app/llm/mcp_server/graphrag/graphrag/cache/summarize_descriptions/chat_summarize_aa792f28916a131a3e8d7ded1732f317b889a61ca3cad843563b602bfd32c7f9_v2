It is also referenced in acupressure practices, particularly for home massage therapy as part of FDr (Fascial Distortion Model) treatment. In TCM, this point is commonly employed to regulate the spleen, liver, and kidney meridians, addressing conditions such as digestive disorders, gynecological issues, and fatigue. Its dual application in both acupuncture and acupressure highlights its therapeutic versatility, though its primary classification remains rooted in classical TCM as a key point on the spleen channel.  \n\nThe point is located on the inner lower leg, approximately three finger-widths above the medial malleolus (inner ankle bone), making it accessible for self-massage or professional needling. While its role in FDr treatment emphasizes manual pressure for fascial and musculoskeletal corrections, its TCM applications focus more on balancing qi and blood flow. Despite differing therapeutic frameworks, both descriptions agree on its anatomical position and its significance in holistic and alternative medicine practices.  \n\nIn summary, **三阴交** serves as a multifunctional point, integral to both traditional acupuncture and modern acupressure techniques, with its usage adapted to varying treatment modalities while retaining its foundational importance in TCM.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167167, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 268, "prompt_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 442, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 110}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
