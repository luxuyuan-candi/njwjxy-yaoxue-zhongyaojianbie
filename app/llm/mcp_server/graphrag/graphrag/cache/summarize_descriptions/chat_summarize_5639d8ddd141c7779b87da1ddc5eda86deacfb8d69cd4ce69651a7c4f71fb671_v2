These drugs are often used in clinical practice, either as monotherapy or in combination with other treatments, such as statins, when low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets are not achieved. By inhibiting the uptake of cholesterol in the intestines, they help lower overall cholesterol levels in the bloodstream.  \n\nIn addition to their role in managing cholesterol, cholesterol absorption inhibitors can be effectively combined with antihypertensive therapy, making them a versatile option for patients with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. Their mechanism of action complements other lipid-lowering agents, particularly statins, by targeting a different pathway in cholesterol metabolism.  \n\nOverall, cholesterol absorption inhibitors serve as an important therapeutic option for patients requiring additional cholesterol control, especially when statin therapy alone is insufficient. Their ability to integrate with other treatments underscores their utility in comprehensive cardiovascular risk management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167226, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 413, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 142}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
