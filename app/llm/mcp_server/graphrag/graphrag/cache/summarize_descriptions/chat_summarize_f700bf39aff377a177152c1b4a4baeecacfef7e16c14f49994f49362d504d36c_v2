It is primarily known for its ability to promote lung function and aid in expelling phlegm, making it a key ingredient in treatments for respiratory conditions. Additionally, 桔梗 is commonly incorporated into multiple TCM formulas designed to facilitate lung qi diffusion, which helps regulate the flow of vital energy in the lungs and alleviate symptoms such as coughs, congestion, and breathing difficulties.  \n\nThe herb’s dual role—enhancing lung function and assisting in qi diffusion—highlights its importance in TCM for addressing both physical and energetic imbalances in the respiratory system. Its consistent use across various formulations underscores its efficacy and versatility in traditional healing practices.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167589, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 166, "prompt_tokens": 169, "total_tokens": 335, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 41}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
