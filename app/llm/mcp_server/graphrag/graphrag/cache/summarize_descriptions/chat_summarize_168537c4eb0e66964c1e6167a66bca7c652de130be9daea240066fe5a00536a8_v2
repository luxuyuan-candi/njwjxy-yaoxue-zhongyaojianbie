One of its notable complications is its association with elevated lipid levels, including high serum triglycerides and cholesterol, leading to secondary hyperlipidemia. The condition disrupts normal lipid metabolism, often resulting in late-stage hyperlipidemia if left unmanaged. While the descriptions vary slightly in phrasing—referring to \"high lipidemia,\" \"elevated serum triglyceride levels,\" or \"high cholesterol\"—they collectively emphasize that Nephrotic Syndrome frequently contributes to abnormal lipid profiles. This dyslipidemia arises due to increased hepatic lipoprotein synthesis and decreased lipid clearance, further complicating the disorder. Thus, Nephrotic Syndrome is consistently recognized as a significant factor in the development of secondary hyperlipidemia, with implications for cardiovascular risk and long-term kidney function.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167372, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 376, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 142}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
