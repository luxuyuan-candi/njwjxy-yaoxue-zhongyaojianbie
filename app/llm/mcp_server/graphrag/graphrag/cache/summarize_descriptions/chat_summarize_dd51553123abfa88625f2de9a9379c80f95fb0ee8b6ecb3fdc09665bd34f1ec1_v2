Primarily known for its ability to warm the channels and alleviate pain, it is commonly employed to treat conditions such as cold limbs and body aches. In clinical practice, 桂枝 is also a key component in herbal formulations like **乌梅丸 (Wu Mei Wan)**, where it is typically administered in doses ranging from **6 to 9 grams**.  \n\nAs a warming herb, 桂枝 plays a vital role in TCM by promoting circulation and dispelling cold, making it particularly effective for symptoms related to poor blood flow or exposure to cold.
