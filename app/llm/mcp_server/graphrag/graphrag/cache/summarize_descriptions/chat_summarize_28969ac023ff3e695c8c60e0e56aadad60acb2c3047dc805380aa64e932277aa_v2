This phenomenon is typically diagnosed using **Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM)** or **Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM)**.\n\nResearch indicates that individuals with white-coat hypertension may face an **increased risk of developing persistent hypertension** and **cardiovascular diseases** over time. The condition is considered a distinct blood pressure abnormality and requires careful evaluation to differentiate it from sustained hypertension. The term \"白大衣性高血压\" (literally \"white-coat hypertension\" in Chinese) reflects the same clinical concept, emphasizing the situational nature of the blood pressure elevation.  \n\nIn summary, white-coat hypertension is a well-documented clinical phenomenon that warrants monitoring due to its potential long-term health implications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559494, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 186, "prompt_tokens": 199, "total_tokens": 385, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 135}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
