This inhibition significantly slows the metabolism of certain drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4, potentially leading to increased plasma concentrations and prolonged effects of those drugs. The interaction is well-documented across multiple sources, confirming that voriconazole's inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 is consistent and clinically relevant.  \n\nThe descriptions provided—whether in English (\"Voriconazole is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4\") or Chinese (\"伏立康唑是CYP3A4的强抑制剂\")—all align in stating the same key relationship. There are no contradictions in the data; instead, the information reinforces the understanding that voriconazole exerts a potent inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, which can influence the pharmacokinetics of co-administered medications metabolized by this enzyme.  \n\nThis interaction is particularly important in therapeutic settings where voriconazole is used, as dose adjustments or alternative treatments may be necessary for drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 to avoid adverse effects or toxicity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167792, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 242, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 437, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 131}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
