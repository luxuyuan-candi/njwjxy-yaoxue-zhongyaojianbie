It is administered intravenously, making it particularly effective in urgent medical scenarios. Nicardipine is indicated for managing high blood pressure in various critical conditions, including acute ischemic stroke patients prior to treatment and pregnant women requiring rapid blood pressure stabilization. As a calcium channel blocker, it works by relaxing blood vessels, thereby reducing vascular resistance and lowering blood pressure. Its intravenous formulation allows for precise and immediate control in acute settings. Overall, Nicardipine serves as a versatile antihypertensive agent in both emergency and non-emergency clinical contexts.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559467, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 348, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 142}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
