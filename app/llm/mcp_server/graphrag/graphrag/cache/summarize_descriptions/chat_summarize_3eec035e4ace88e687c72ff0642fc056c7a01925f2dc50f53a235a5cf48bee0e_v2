This condition is often associated with post-stroke outcomes, where it is commonly screened using tools like the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The presence of cognitive impairment post-stroke can influence rehabilitation progress and long-term recovery. Additionally, cognitive impairment has been linked to late-life depression, suggesting a bidirectional relationship where depressive symptoms may exacerbate cognitive decline, and vice versa. Together, these factors highlight the multifaceted nature of cognitive impairment, which arises from neurological events like stroke or psychological conditions such as depression, necessitating comprehensive assessment and tailored interventions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167563, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 332, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 117}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
