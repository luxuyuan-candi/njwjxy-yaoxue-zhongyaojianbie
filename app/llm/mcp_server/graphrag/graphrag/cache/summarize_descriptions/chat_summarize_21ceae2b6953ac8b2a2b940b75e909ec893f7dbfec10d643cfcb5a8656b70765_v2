It is also known as *Oxylytic Acid* and shares similar therapeutic applications with niacin but exhibits longer-lasting and more potent anti-lipolytic effects. Primarily administered orally, the typical dosage is **0.25 g per dose**, taken **two to three times daily**.  \n\nAcipimox is primarily used to **lower triglyceride and cholesterol levels** in the blood, making it beneficial for managing dyslipidemia. Additionally, it has been shown to **improve glucose tolerance**, which may be advantageous for patients with metabolic disorders. Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting lipolysis, thereby reducing the release of free fatty acids and improving lipid metabolism.  \n\nIn summary, Acipimox is a niacin-derived medication with enhanced efficacy and duration of action, prescribed for its lipid-modifying and glucose-regulating properties. Its oral administration and well-defined dosing regimen make it a practical option for long-term management of hyperlipidemia and related metabolic conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167450, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 226, "prompt_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 456, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 166}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
