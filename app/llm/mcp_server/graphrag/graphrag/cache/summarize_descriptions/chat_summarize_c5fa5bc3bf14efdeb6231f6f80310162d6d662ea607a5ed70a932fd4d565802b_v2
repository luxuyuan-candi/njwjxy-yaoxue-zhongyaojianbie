It is primarily employed to regulate liver function and relieve fever, making it a key component in treatments aimed at balancing liver qi. Additionally, 柴胡 is an essential ingredient in **补中益气汤 (Bǔ Zhōng Yì Qì Tāng)**, a classic TCM formula designed to tonify the middle burner (spleen and stomach) and boost qi. Its dual role in both liver regulation and qi enhancement highlights its versatility in addressing imbalances related to liver stagnation and systemic qi deficiency.  \n\nIn summary, 柴胡 serves as a vital medicinal herb in TCM, valued for its ability to harmonize liver qi, reduce fever, and contribute to formulations like 补中益气汤 that support overall qi circulation and vitality.
