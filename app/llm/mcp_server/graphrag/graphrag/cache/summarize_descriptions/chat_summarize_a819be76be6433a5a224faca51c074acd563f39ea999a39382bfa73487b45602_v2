Traditionally, it is primarily used to treat alternating episodes of chills and fever, a symptom pattern often associated with conditions like malaria or certain types of infections. Additionally, the formula is employed to address disorders related to liver-spleen disharmony, particularly cases where liver stagnation (肝郁) overacts on the spleen (克脾土), leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain.  \n\nWhile the first description emphasizes its role in managing fever and chills, the second highlights its application in regulating liver-spleen dysfunction and alleviating related discomfort. These uses are not contradictory but rather reflect the formula's broad therapeutic scope in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). **小柴胡汤** thus serves as a versatile remedy for both external pathogenic conditions (e.g., fever syndromes) and internal imbalances (e.g., digestive disturbances caused by emotional or physiological stress).  \n\nIn summary, **小柴胡汤** is a well-known TCM prescription with dual applications: addressing alternating chills and fever, as well as harmonizing liver-spleen interactions to relieve abdominal pain and other related symptoms. Its efficacy in these areas has made it a staple in herbal medicine for centuries.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167481, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 257, "prompt_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 434, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 113}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
