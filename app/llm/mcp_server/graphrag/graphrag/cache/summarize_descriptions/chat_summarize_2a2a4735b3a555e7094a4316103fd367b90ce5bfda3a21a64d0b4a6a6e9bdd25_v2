It is commonly used in the treatment of heart failure, particularly when ARBs or ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) are not well tolerated by patients. However, concurrent use of ARNI and ARB (excluding cases where they share the same active component) is contraindicated due to potential risks, including excessive blockade of the renin-angiotensin system, which may lead to adverse effects such as hypotension, hyperkalemia, or renal dysfunction.  \n\nIn summary, while ARNI leverages ARB-like effects, they should not be co-administered outside of specific exceptions, and ARNI serves as an alternative when ARBs or ACEIs are unsuitable for heart failure management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559766, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 200, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 376, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 112}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
