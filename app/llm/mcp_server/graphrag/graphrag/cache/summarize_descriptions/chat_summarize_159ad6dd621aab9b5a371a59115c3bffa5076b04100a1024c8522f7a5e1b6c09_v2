Her work examines the relationship between intestinal microecology and diarrhea, drawing insights from the *Huangdi Neijing* (*The Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon*), a foundational text of traditional Chinese medicine. As one of the authors of this study, she contributes to the interdisciplinary research bridging ancient medical theories with modern microbiological science. The study likely investigates how traditional concepts of visceral dysfunction related to diarrhea align with contemporary understandings of gut microbiota.  \n\nNo contradictory information was found in the provided descriptions, confirming her role as a co-author of this research.
