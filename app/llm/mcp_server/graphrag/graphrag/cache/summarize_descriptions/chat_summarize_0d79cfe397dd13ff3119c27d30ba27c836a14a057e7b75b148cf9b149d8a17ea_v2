They are known to induce hypertension through multiple mechanisms, such as enhancing the effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), increasing vascular sensitivity to catecholamines, and promoting water and sodium retention. Due to these effects, glucocorticoid-induced hypertension may require treatment with antihypertensive medications, including diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCB), or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB). In some cases, minimizing the dose of glucocorticoids may also be necessary to manage blood pressure effectively.  \n\nThis summary integrates all provided descriptions, resolving any potential contradictions by presenting a cohesive explanation of glucocorticoids' hypertensive effects and their clinical management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559507, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 387, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 153}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
