It has been the focal point for hypertension surveys and the production of consensus documents, as well as epidemiological studies on depression. Additionally, China has generated studies and guidelines addressing other health concerns, such as gout.  \n\nRecent data from the National Rheumatology Data Center network registry and follow-up studies indicate that the prevalence of gout in China is approximately 1%–3%, with an increasing trend observed in recent years. The condition is more common in men, with a male-to-female ratio of 15:1, while women predominantly develop gout after menopause. The average age of onset is 48.28 years, though the disease is gradually becoming more prevalent among younger populations.  \n\nThese findings highlight China's active role in medical research, spanning chronic diseases such as hypertension, depression, and gout, while also reflecting shifting demographic trends in disease prevalence. The country's contributions to clinical guidelines and epidemiological surveillance underscore its importance in global health research.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752166961, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 215, "prompt_tokens": 251, "total_tokens": 466, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 187}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
