They are released from adipose tissue (fat stores) and can be transported to the liver, where they serve as substrates for triglyceride synthesis, a process essential for energy storage. Additionally, fatty acids function as vital energy sources for various tissues, much like fuel powers a car, providing the body with the necessary substrates for cellular respiration and ATP production.  \n\nIn summary, fatty acids are versatile molecules involved in both energy production and storage. They are mobilized from fat tissue when needed and utilized by the liver to generate triglycerides, while also serving as a primary energy source for bodily functions.
