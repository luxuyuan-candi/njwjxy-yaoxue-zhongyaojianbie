They share a similar mechanism of action, targeting the Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein to reduce cholesterol absorption, thereby lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in the blood.  \n\nWhile both drugs belong to the same therapeutic class and exhibit comparable pharmacological effects, they may differ in their specific formulations, clinical applications, or regional availability. However, the provided descriptions do not highlight any significant distinctions between them, emphasizing instead their shared role as cholesterol-lowering agents with closely related mechanisms.  \n\nIn summary, 依折麦布 and 海博麦布 are functionally similar as cholesterol absorption inhibitors, making them valuable options for managing hypercholesterolemia in patients who require adjunctive or alternative therapies to statins. Further details regarding their pharmacokinetics, efficacy, or safety profiles would be needed to delineate any potential differences between the two drugs.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167688, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 225, "prompt_tokens": 161, "total_tokens": 386, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 97}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
