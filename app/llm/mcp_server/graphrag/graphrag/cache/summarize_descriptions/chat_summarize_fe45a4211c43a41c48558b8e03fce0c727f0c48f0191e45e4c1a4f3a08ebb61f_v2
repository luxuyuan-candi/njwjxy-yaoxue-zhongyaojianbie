HDL-C levels are inversely associated with ASCVD risk, meaning higher HDL-C concentrations generally correlate with lower risk, while low HDL-C is a recognized risk factor for ASCVD. As part of a comprehensive evaluation, HDL-C measurements are utilized to assess and manage ASCVD risk, aiding clinicians in stratifying patients and guiding preventive or therapeutic interventions.  \n\nThe relationship between HDL-C and ASCVD underscores its importance in cardiovascular health, with low levels signaling increased risk. Thus, HDL-C is routinely included in lipid panels and risk assessment tools to provide a more complete picture of an individual's ASCVD susceptibility. By integrating HDL-C data with other risk factors, healthcare providers can better tailor management strategies to mitigate ASCVD progression.  \n\n(Word count: 149)", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167664, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 197, "prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 408, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 147}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
