Known for its therapeutic properties, it is commonly incorporated into teas, dietary regimens, and herbal formulations.  \n\nIn TCM, 橘皮 is classified as a food-medicine substance (食药物质) and is valued for its ability to strengthen the spleen (健脾), resolve dampness (化湿), and regulate digestive functions. It is particularly recommended for seasonal dietary adjustments during the long summer (长夏膳食调理), where dampness and digestive imbalances are prevalent.  \n\nClinically, 橘皮 is utilized in the treatment of hyperlipidemia (高脂血症), especially for patterns such as phlegm-damp obstruction (痰浊内阻型), phlegm-stasis intermingling (痰瘀互结型), and spleen deficiency with dampness excess (脾虚湿盛型). As a fundamental component in anti-hyperlipidemia formulas, it works to dry dampness, transform phlegm (燥湿化痰), fortify the spleen, and counteract nausea or rebellious qi (降逆止呕).  \n\nBeyond its medicinal applications, 橘皮 is also employed in culinary practices, adding flavor and health benefits to food. Its dual role as both a therapeutic agent and a culinary ingredient underscores its importance in traditional Chinese health practices.  \n\nIn summary, 橘皮 serves as a multipurpose remedy with applications in digestive health, lipid metabolism regulation, and seasonal wellness, while also enhancing food preparations. Its efficacy in addressing dampness-related disorders and metabolic imbalances solidifies its prominence in TCM.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167262, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 332, "prompt_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 578, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 182}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
