It is administered intravenously and works by blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors, leading to vasodilation and a subsequent reduction in blood pressure.  \n\nIn clinical settings, phentolamine serves two key purposes:  \n1. **Diagnostic Use**: It helps confirm pheochromocytoma by monitoring blood pressure response following administration. A significant drop in blood pressure may indicate the presence of the condition.  \n2. **Therapeutic Use**: It is employed to manage acute hypertensive crises, including those occurring during surgical procedures, by rapidly lowering elevated blood pressure.  \n\nCommon side effects of phentolamine include **tachycardia** (rapid heart rate) and **headache**, which are attributed to its vasodilatory effects. Due to its potent action, it is typically used under medical supervision to ensure proper dosing and monitoring.  \n\nOverall, phentolamine is a critical agent in both diagnosing and controlling hypertension linked to pheochromocytoma, though its use requires careful consideration of potential adverse effects.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167076, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 240, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 446, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 142}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
