It is most commonly observed in elderly patients, with a reported prevalence of 39.75% in this population, though it can also occur in adolescents. ISH is particularly prevalent in individuals over 50 years old and is the most frequent type of hypertension among the elderly.  \n\nThe condition is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications and mortality. Treatment typically involves calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and thiazide diuretics. Additionally, ISH may develop in patients with other forms of hypertension, such as Isolated Diastolic Hypertension (IDH), as their condition progresses.  \n\nIn summary, ISH is a clinically significant form of hypertension marked by high systolic pressure, normal diastolic pressure, and a strong association with aging and cardiovascular risk.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559495, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 331, "total_tokens": 520, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 267}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
