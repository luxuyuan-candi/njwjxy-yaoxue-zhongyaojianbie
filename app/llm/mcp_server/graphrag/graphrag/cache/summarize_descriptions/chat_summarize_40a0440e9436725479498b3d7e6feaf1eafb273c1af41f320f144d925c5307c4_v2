This inhibition slows the metabolism of certain drugs, such as metoprolol, which relies on CYP2D6 for its breakdown. As a result, concurrent use of 普罗帕酮 with medications metabolized by CYP2D6, like metoprolol, may lead to increased plasma concentrations and prolonged effects of those drugs. Both descriptions confirm that 普罗帕酮 acts as a CYP2D6 inhibitor, though one specifically mentions its impact on metoprolol metabolism while the other broadly states its enzyme-inhibiting effect. The combined summary clarifies that 普罗帕酮's inhibition of CYP2D6 can influence the pharmacokinetics of substrates like metoprolol, potentially necessitating dose adjustments or monitoring in clinical settings.  \n\n(Word count: 120)", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167783, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 180, "prompt_tokens": 173, "total_tokens": 353, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 109}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
