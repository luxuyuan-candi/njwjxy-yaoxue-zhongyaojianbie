According to recommendations, men should aim to maintain a waist circumference below **90 cm**, while women should keep theirs below **85 cm**. These thresholds are based on evidence linking excessive abdominal fat to increased risks of metabolic and cardiovascular conditions.  \n\nAdditionally, waist circumference is highlighted as a useful measure for managing **blood pressure and cholesterol levels**, as abdominal obesity is closely associated with hypertension and dyslipidemia. Monitoring and maintaining a healthy waist circumference can thus serve as a preventive strategy for reducing the likelihood of these conditions.  \n\nIn summary, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE is an important indicator of health, with specific gender-based targets (90 cm for men, 85 cm for women) to mitigate risks related to cardiovascular and metabolic health, including blood pressure and cholesterol management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167066, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 175, "prompt_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 352, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 113}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
