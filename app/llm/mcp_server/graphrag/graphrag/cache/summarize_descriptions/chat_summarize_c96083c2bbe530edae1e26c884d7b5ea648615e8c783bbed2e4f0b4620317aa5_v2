It is a significant focus of research and clinical practice, particularly in geriatrics, as evidenced by studies published in *Geriatrics* (2008) that explore its causes, assessment, treatment, and management.  \n\nThe condition is also the namesake of the journal *Dysphagia*, which publishes research on swallowing disorders, including systematic reviews on therapeutic interventions. One such review examined the effects of therapy for oropharyngeal dysphagia administered by speech and language therapists.  \n\nPost-stroke dysphagia is a common manifestation of the disorder, often requiring diagnostic assessments such as Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) or Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). Management typically involves a combination of compensatory strategies, rehabilitative exercises, and dietary modifications tailored to the patient's needs.  \n\nIn summary, DYSPHAGIA encompasses both a clinical condition affecting swallowing function and an academic journal dedicated to advancing research in the field. It is widely studied in geriatric and post-stroke populations, with diagnostic tools like VFSS and FEES guiding evidence-based therapeutic approaches.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167576, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 251, "prompt_tokens": 222, "total_tokens": 473, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 158}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
