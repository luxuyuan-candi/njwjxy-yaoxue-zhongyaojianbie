They function by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure.  \n\nThese medications are rarely metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, meaning they have a low likelihood of pharmacokinetic drug interactions. However, they may exhibit pharmacodynamic interactions with other drugs, particularly those affecting blood pressure or kidney function. Despite this, clinical reports suggest that ACE inhibitors generally have minimal impact on lipid metabolism and no significant clinically relevant drug interactions.  \n\nACEIs are widely recognized as a first-line treatment for hypertension due to their efficacy and safety profile. Their therapeutic applications extend to heart failure management, where they help improve outcomes by reducing cardiac workload.  \n\nIn summary, ACE inhibitors are a well-established class of antihypertensive and cardioprotective drugs with a favorable metabolic profile and limited drug interaction risks, making them a reliable option for patients with cardiovascular conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167067, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 218, "prompt_tokens": 255, "total_tokens": 473, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 191}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
