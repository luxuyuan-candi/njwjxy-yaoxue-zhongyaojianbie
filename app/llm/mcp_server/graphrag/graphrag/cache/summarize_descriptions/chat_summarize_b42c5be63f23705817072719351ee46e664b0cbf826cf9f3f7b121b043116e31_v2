As a class of antidepressants, MAOIs work by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. It is important to exercise caution when combining MAOIs with other medications, particularly SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), due to potential interactions that may lead to adverse effects. The need for careful monitoring and dosage adjustments underscores the importance of medical supervision when using MAOIs in treatment regimens.  \n\n(Note: The third description provided was in Chinese, stating that MAOIs require special attention when used in combination with SSRIs, which aligns with the known pharmacological precautions for this drug class.
