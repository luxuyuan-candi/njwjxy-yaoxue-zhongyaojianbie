White coat hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure readings in clinical settings, often due to anxiety, while normal readings occur in other environments. If left untreated, white coat hypertension can progress to persistent hypertension, a more serious condition marked by consistently high blood pressure regardless of the setting. Compared to persistent hypertension, white coat hypertension carries a lower risk of cardiovascular complications. However, both conditions warrant monitoring and appropriate management to mitigate potential health risks.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559773, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 112, "prompt_tokens": 158, "total_tokens": 270, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 94}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
