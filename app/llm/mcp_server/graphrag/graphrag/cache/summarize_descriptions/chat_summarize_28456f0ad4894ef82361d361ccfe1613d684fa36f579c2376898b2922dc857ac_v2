At higher doses than those required for its vitamin effects, niacin demonstrates significant lipid-regulating properties, making it a therapeutic option for managing high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It is considered an alternative to statins for specific patient groups, particularly those who may not tolerate statin therapy well.  \n\nThe drug class includes extended-release niacin tablets and related compounds like acipimox, both of which are used to reduce lipid levels. Its efficacy and optimal dosage depend on the patient's baseline lipid profile, with adjustments made to achieve desired therapeutic outcomes.  \n\nIn addition to its lipid-lowering effects, niacin can enhance the vasodilatory properties of antihypertensive medications, potentially leading to a drop in blood pressure. This interaction underscores the importance of careful monitoring when niacin is used alongside other cardiovascular drugs.  \n\nOverall, niacin functions as a versatile agent in managing dyslipidemia, offering benefits for patients who require alternative or adjunctive lipid-modifying therapy while necessitating attention to potential hemodynamic effects.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167447, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 230, "prompt_tokens": 278, "total_tokens": 508, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 214}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
