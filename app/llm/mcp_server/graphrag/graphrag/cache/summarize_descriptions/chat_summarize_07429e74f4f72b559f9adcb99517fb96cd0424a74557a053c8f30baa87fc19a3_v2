This condition has been studied across various imaging modalities in neuroradiology research to better understand its structure, hemodynamics, and clinical implications. Cerebral AVM poses significant health risks, including the potential to cause secondary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) due to the high-pressure blood flow through the malformed vessels, which are structurally weaker than normal vasculature. The neuroradiological evaluation of cerebral AVM is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring, as different imaging techniques provide complementary insights into its morphology and hemodynamic behavior. Overall, cerebral AVM represents a complex vascular disorder with serious neurological consequences, necessitating careful assessment and management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167205, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 170, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 354, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 120}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
