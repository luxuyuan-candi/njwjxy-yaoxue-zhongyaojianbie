It serves as an important indicator of target organ damage, especially in patients with hypertension, helping clinicians gauge the impact of elevated blood pressure on cardiac structure. By standardizing left ventricular mass relative to body size, LVMI provides a more accurate assessment of heart muscle thickening compared to absolute measurements. This metric is widely utilized in cardiovascular diagnostics and risk stratification to guide treatment decisions and monitor disease progression.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167059, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 116, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 297, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 117}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
