CCBs, particularly dihydropyridine CCBs, are recommended as part of initial combination therapy for hypertension. These two drug classes are also frequently combined for hypertension management in obese patients due to their complementary mechanisms of action. Additionally, both ACEIs and dihydropyridine CCBs are specifically recommended as initial treatments for hypertension in tumor patients, highlighting their versatility and efficacy across different patient populations. Overall, ACEIs and CCBs serve as key therapeutic options for hypertension, either alone or in combination, depending on the clinical context and patient-specific factors.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559775, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 141, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 334, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 129}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
