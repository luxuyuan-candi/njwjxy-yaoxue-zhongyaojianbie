Both are classified as antihypertensive medications and are widely used to manage high blood pressure. While their mechanisms differ—ACEI inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, whereas ARB block the binding of angiotensin II to its receptors—they share a common goal of reducing blood pressure and mitigating cardiovascular risks.  \n\nIn addition to their primary use in hypertension, both ACEI and ARB are prescribed for conditions such as heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and post-myocardial infarction care, owing to their protective effects on the heart and kidneys. Notably, these drugs have minimal impact on lipid metabolism, making them suitable for patients with concurrent lipid disorders.  \n\nDespite their similarities, ACEI and ARB are not interchangeable in all clinical scenarios due to differences in side-effect profiles (e.g., ACEI may cause a dry cough, while ARB are less likely to do so). However, both remain cornerstone therapies in cardiovascular medicine, offering effective blood pressure control and organ protection. Their shared role in managing hypertension and related conditions underscores their importance in modern pharmacotherapy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167629, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 259, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 459, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 136}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
