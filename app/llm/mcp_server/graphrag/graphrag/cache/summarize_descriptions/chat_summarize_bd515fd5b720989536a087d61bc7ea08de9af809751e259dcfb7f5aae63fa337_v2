HDP encompasses four main types: gestational hypertension, preeclampsia/eclampsia, chronic hypertension in pregnancy, and chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. The condition is diagnosed when blood pressure reaches or exceeds **140/90 mmHg**, at which point antihypertensive treatment is typically initiated.  \n\nHDP poses significant health risks, including an increased likelihood of complications such as placental abruption, cerebral hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and organ failure. Additionally, women with HDP face long-term cardiovascular consequences, with **25% requiring blood pressure maintenance within two years postpartum** and a **2.4 times higher risk of developing hypertension within 10 years** compared to women without HDP. The condition is also a major risk factor for postpartum cardiovascular events, underscoring the importance of ongoing monitoring and management.  \n\nOverall, HDP necessitates careful blood pressure control during and after pregnancy to mitigate both immediate and long-term health risks.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559499, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 225, "prompt_tokens": 321, "total_tokens": 546, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 257}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
