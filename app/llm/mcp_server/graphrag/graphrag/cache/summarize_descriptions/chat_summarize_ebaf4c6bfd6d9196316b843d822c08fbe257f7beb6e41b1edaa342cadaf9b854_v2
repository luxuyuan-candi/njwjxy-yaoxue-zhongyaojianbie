HDL accounts for approximately 25% of total cholesterol in the body and plays a critical role in transporting excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver for processing and excretion, a process known as reverse cholesterol transport. This function helps prevent the buildup of cholesterol in arteries, thereby reducing the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.  \n\nHDL is measured in millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), with higher levels generally associated with better cardiovascular protection. Low HDL levels, conversely, correlate with an increased incidence of coronary heart disease. Beyond cholesterol transport, HDL activates key enzymes involved in lipoprotein metabolism and contributes to the clearance of cholesterol from tissues, further supporting its protective role in the cardiovascular system.  \n\nOverall, HDL is recognized for its ability to safeguard against heart disease by promoting efficient cholesterol removal and maintaining arterial health. Its multifaceted functions underscore its importance in cardiovascular risk assessment and preventive health strategies.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517947, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 215, "prompt_tokens": 285, "total_tokens": 500, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 221}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
