Their collaborative work focuses on understanding how shoe selection influences rehabilitation outcomes, particularly in improving movement efficiency and reducing energy consumption for individuals recovering from stroke. The study highlights the importance of footwear in conjunction with AFOs to enhance functional mobility, offering insights that could aid in optimizing rehabilitation strategies for post-stroke patients. Together, their research contributes to the broader field of stroke recovery and orthotic intervention.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167614, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 220, "total_tokens": 352, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 156}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
