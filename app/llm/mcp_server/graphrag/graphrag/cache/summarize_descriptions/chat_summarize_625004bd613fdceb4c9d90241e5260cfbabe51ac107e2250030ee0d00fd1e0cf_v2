These medications work by blocking the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that constricts blood vessels, thereby helping to lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the heart.  \n\nARBs are known for their favorable pharmacokinetic profile, particularly their minimal interaction with the **CYP450 enzyme system**, which reduces the risk of metabolic drug-drug interactions. However, some ARBs may still exhibit **pharmacodynamic interactions**, meaning their effects could be influenced by other medications acting on the same physiological pathways. While most ARBs are not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, there is variability among individual drugs within the class regarding their metabolic pathways.  \n\nIn summary, ARBs are widely prescribed for hypertension and cardiovascular management due to their efficacy and generally low risk of metabolic interactions. Their mechanism of action, safety profile, and therapeutic applications make them a key option in antihypertensive treatment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167067, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 209, "prompt_tokens": 279, "total_tokens": 488, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 215}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
