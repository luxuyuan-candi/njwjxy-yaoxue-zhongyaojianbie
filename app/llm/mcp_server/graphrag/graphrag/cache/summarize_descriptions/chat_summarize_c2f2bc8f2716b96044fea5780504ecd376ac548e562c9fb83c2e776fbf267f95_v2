It is often prescribed in combination with other drugs for the treatment of hypertension and related conditions. The medication has an elimination half-life of approximately 1.5–2 hours and is typically administered in a daily dosage range of 25–100 mg. While it was historically utilized to counteract potassium loss caused by other diuretics, its use has become less common in recent years due to the reduced risk of hypokalemia associated with low-dose thiazide diuretics. Despite this, it remains an option in specific clinical scenarios where potassium retention is a concern.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559474, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 349, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 147}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
