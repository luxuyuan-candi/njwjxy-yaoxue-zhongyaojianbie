It is available as an ointment, patch, or mouthwash, commonly used to treat oral ulcers due to its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Additionally, dexamethasone serves as a short-term treatment option for significant cerebral edema, leveraging its ability to reduce inflammation and swelling in the brain. However, its use in this context remains controversial due to potential complications, such as adverse metabolic effects or delayed recovery in certain conditions.  \n\nWhile dexamethasone is effective in managing localized inflammation (e.g., oral ulcers) and acute neurological conditions, its application must be carefully weighed against risks, particularly in prolonged or high-dose regimens. The drugâ€™s versatility across different formulations underscores its broad utility, but clinical judgment is essential to balance benefits and drawbacks in each use case.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167030, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 168, "prompt_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 356, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 124}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
