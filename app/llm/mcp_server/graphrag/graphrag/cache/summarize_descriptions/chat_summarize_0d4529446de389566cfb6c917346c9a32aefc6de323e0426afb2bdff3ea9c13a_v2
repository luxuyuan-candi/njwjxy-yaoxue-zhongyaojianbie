These drugs, which include **dapagliflozin and empagliflozin**, help lower blood glucose levels by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the kidneys. Beyond glycemic control, SGLT2i has demonstrated **cardioprotective and renoprotective effects**, making them beneficial for patients with **chronic kidney disease (CKD)**—even in those without diabetes—as well as for individuals with **heart failure, particularly HFrEF (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction)**.  \n\nSGLT2i is **recommended for CKD patients with an eGFR ≥20 mL/(min·1.73m²)** and has been shown to **reduce hospitalization rates, mortality, and improve prognosis in heart failure patients**. Additionally, these medications contribute to **blood pressure reduction** and play a role in **managing metabolic syndrome**, offering a **comprehensive approach** to treating interrelated conditions. Their benefits extend to **cardiovascular risk reduction**, reinforcing their use in patients with **type 2 diabetes, CKD, or heart failure**.  \n\nIn summary, SGLT2i is a **versatile class of drugs** with **glycemic, cardiorenal, and metabolic advantages**, making them a **key therapeutic option** for multiple high-risk patient populations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559484, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 305, "prompt_tokens": 487, "total_tokens": 792, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 423}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
