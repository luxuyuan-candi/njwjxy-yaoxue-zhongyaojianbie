It serves as a standard diagnostic tool for various hypertension-related conditions, such as **white-coat hypertension**, **morning hypertension**, **nighttime hypertension**, and **masked hypertension** (隐蔽性高血压). ABPM helps identify abnormal blood pressure fluctuations, including irregularities in circadian rhythms, such as elevated nighttime or early-morning blood pressure. By providing automated, continuous measurements, ABPM enables healthcare providers to assess blood pressure patterns more accurately than isolated clinic readings, making it a critical tool in hypertension management and diagnosis.  \n\nThe method is particularly valuable for detecting conditions that may be missed in traditional office settings, such as **white-coat hypertension** (where blood pressure is elevated only in clinical environments) and **nighttime hypertension** (abnormally high blood pressure during sleep). Additionally, ABPM aids in evaluating **morning hypertension**, a risk factor for cardiovascular events. Its comprehensive 24-hour monitoring allows for a more precise assessment of blood pressure behavior, contributing to better-informed treatment decisions.  \n\n(Note: The Chinese description provided—\"动态血压监测有助于发现异常血压波动、夜间或清晨高血压等血压节律失常，评估白大衣性高血压和隐蔽性高血压\"—has been incorporated into the summary, reinforcing ABPM's role in detecting blood pressure rhythm abnormalities and specific hypertension subtypes.)", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559447, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 296, "prompt_tokens": 331, "total_tokens": 627, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 267}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
