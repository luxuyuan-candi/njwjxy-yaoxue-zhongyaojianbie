Key drugs in this class include venlafaxine (文拉法辛) and duloxetine (度洛西汀). SNRIs work by inhibiting the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, thereby increasing their levels in the brain to improve mood and emotional regulation.  \n\nWhile effective for mental health conditions, some studies suggest that SNRIs may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) during pregnancy. However, further research is needed to fully understand this potential risk.  \n\nOverall, SNRIs are widely recognized as an important pharmacological option for managing depression and anxiety, with venlafaxine and duloxetine being among the most commonly prescribed medications in this class.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559393, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 188, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 430, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 178}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
