It is considered a subtype of morning hypertension and is marked by a sharp rise in blood pressure during the early morning hours. Notably, research indicates that the magnitude of the morning blood pressure surge tends to be significantly higher in Asian populations compared to European populations. However, despite its clinical recognition, there is currently a lack of standardized diagnostic criteria for this condition. The combined description highlights both the physiological characteristics of the phenomenon and its epidemiological variations across different ethnic groups.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559495, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 317, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 123}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
