Research and guidelines on various health issues, including mental health and chronic diseases, are developed within the country.  \n\nOne notable area of study is the prevalence of gout, which affects approximately 1%–3% of the population and has been increasing annually. The condition is more common in men, while women typically develop it after menopause. Data from the National Rheumatology Data Center's network registration and follow-up studies indicate a male-to-female ratio of 15:1, with an average age of onset at 48.28 years. Additionally, the disease is gradually becoming more prevalent among younger individuals.  \n\nThese findings highlight China's active role in public health research, addressing both mental health concerns like depression and chronic conditions such as gout, while also tracking demographic trends in disease prevalence.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517866, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 177, "prompt_tokens": 224, "total_tokens": 401, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 0, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 224}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
