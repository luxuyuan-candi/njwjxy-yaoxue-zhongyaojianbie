They are also effective in treating coronary syndromes and heart failure, making them versatile in cardiovascular care. Among the various types, selective β1 blockers are often preferred for elderly patients due to their targeted action. Additionally, beta-blockers are considered a first-line treatment for hypertensive patients with elevated heart rates, as they help regulate both blood pressure and heart rate.  \n\nThis summary integrates all provided descriptions, highlighting the key therapeutic uses and considerations for beta-blockers without contradictions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559490, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 141, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 344, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 139}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
