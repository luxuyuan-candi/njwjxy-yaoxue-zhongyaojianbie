ACEIs are widely used to treat **hypertension** and are particularly recommended for patients with comorbid conditions such as **diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), proteinuria, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), chronic heart failure (HFrEF), chronic coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and peripheral artery disease (PAD)**. They improve prognosis in **heart failure patients** by reducing hospitalization rates and mortality and may also enhance walking distance in **PAD patients with hypertension**.  \n\nACEIs are considered **first-line therapy** for hypertension in **diabetic patients**, as they help protect target organs without worsening metabolic conditions. They are also recommended for **systemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma renal crisis**. However, they should **not be combined with ARBs (Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers) or direct renin inhibitors** due to increased risks of **kidney events and hyperkalemia**. Additionally, ACEIs are **contraindicated in pregnancy** due to potential fetal risks and should be **discontinued one day before surgery** to avoid **intraoperative hypotension**.  \n\nWhen transitioning from ACEIs to **ARNIs (Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitors)**, a washout period of **at least 36 hours** is required. Some studies suggest ACEIs may also be associated with a **reduced risk of mood disorders**. Common examples of ACEIs include **captopril and fosinopril**, which are also used in pediatric hypertension management.  \n\nIn summary, ACEIs are a versatile class of **RAS inhibitors** with broad applications in cardiovascular and renal diseases, serving as a foundational therapy in **combined antihypertensive regimens**, especially for high-risk patients.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559461, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 387, "prompt_tokens": 849, "total_tokens": 1236, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 785}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
