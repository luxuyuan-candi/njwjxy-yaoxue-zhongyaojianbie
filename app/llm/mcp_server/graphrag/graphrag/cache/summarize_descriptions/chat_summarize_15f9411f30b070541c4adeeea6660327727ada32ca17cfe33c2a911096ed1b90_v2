It functions as a non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, effectively reducing inflammation and alleviating pain. While some descriptions indicate it is available over-the-counter, its regulatory status may vary by region.  \n\nDiclofenac is commonly prescribed for acute pain management, with a typical dosage of 50 mg administered three times daily due to its relatively short half-life of approximately two hours. This pharmacokinetic profile makes it suitable for short-term use in conditions requiring rapid pain relief.  \n\nAs an NSAID, diclofenac shares therapeutic properties with other drugs in its class, such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects. However, its accessibility (prescription vs. over-the-counter) and specific dosing regimens should be confirmed based on local medical guidelines. Overall, diclofenac is a widely used medication for managing pain and inflammation, with its usage tailored to individual patient needs and regional regulations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752166979, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 219, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 425, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 142}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
