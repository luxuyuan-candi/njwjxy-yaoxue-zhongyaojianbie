It poses significant health risks, including cardiovascular complications, particularly in hypertensive patients. CKD is also associated with metabolic disturbances, such as secondary high cholesterol, which further exacerbates cardiovascular risks. The disease's impact on kidney function and its role in contributing to other systemic conditions, like hypertension and dyslipidemia, underscores its importance as a major public health concern. Managing CKD involves addressing both renal dysfunction and its secondary effects, such as cardiovascular disease and elevated cholesterol levels, to mitigate long-term complications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517956, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 117, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 298, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 117}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
