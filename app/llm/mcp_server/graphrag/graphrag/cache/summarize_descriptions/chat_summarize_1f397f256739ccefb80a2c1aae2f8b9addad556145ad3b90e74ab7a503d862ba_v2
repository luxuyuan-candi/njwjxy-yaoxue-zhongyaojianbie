They are primarily used to treat hypertension but also have applications in managing conditions such as **diffuse toxic goiter**, where they counteract the effects of excess thyroid hormone. Additionally, beta-blockers are recommended for **tumor patients** experiencing high sympathetic nerve tension, stress, or pain due to their ability to modulate the sympathetic nervous system. Research has also explored their role in **COPD patients** with heightened cardiovascular risk, as they may provide cardiovascular benefits in this population. Overall, beta-blockers serve as versatile medications with applications in cardiovascular, endocrine, oncological, and respiratory care.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559464, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 147, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 364, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 153}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
