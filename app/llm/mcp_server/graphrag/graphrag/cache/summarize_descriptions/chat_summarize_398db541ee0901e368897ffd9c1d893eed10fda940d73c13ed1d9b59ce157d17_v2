Elevated cholesterol levels contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases by promoting the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can lead to narrowed or blocked blood vessels. This process, known as atherosclerosis, increases the risk of serious complications like stroke, heart attack, and other cardiovascular events. The relationship between high cholesterol and cardiovascular diseases is well-established, underscoring the importance of managing cholesterol levels through lifestyle changes, medication, or other interventions to reduce the risk of these potentially life-threatening conditions.  \n\nThe provided descriptions consistently emphasize the role of high cholesterol as a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases, with no contradictions.
