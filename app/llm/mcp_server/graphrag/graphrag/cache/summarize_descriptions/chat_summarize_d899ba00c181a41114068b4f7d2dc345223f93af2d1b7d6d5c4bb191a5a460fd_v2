Both ingredients are combined in a traditional Chinese medicinal drink, which is specifically employed as a remedy for high cholesterol. This combination leverages the synergistic effects of 何首乌, known for its liver-nourishing and blood-tonifying properties, and 山楂, which aids digestion and promotes cardiovascular health. Their joint use in this recipe highlights their complementary roles in addressing lipid metabolism disorders, making the preparation a recognized natural treatment for managing cholesterol levels in traditional Chinese medicine practices.  \n\nThe pairing of these herbs reflects a holistic approach, where 何首乌’s potential lipid-lowering and anti-aging benefits are enhanced by 山楂’s ability to improve circulation and reduce blood lipid accumulation.
