It works by relaxing blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure. However, its pharmacokinetics can be significantly affected by drug interactions, particularly with **itraconazole**, an antifungal medication. When co-administered with itraconazole, felodipine levels are drastically increased, leading to a heightened risk of hypotension due to excessive blood pressure reduction. This interaction underscores the importance of monitoring and potential dose adjustments when these drugs are used together.  \n\nIn summary, felodipine is an effective antihypertensive agent, but its therapeutic use requires caution in the presence of interacting medications like itraconazole to avoid adverse effects such as severe hypotension.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167492, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 153, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 329, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 48}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
