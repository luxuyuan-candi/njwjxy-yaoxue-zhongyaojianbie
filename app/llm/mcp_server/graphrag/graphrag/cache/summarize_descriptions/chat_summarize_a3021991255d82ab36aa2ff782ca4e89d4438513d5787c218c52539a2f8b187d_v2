These enzymes facilitate the conjugation of glucuronic acid to various substrates, including pharmaceuticals like **canagliflozin**, enhancing their solubility and promoting excretion. UGTs are integral to drug metabolism and interactions, influencing the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of numerous medications. By mediating glucuronidation, they contribute to the detoxification and elimination of both endogenous and exogenous compounds. The descriptions collectively emphasize UGT's central function in metabolic pathways, underscoring its importance in pharmacology and therapeutic drug monitoring. No contradictions exist between the provided descriptions; instead, they complement each other by highlighting different aspects of UGT's role in drug metabolism.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517980, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 341, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 119}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
