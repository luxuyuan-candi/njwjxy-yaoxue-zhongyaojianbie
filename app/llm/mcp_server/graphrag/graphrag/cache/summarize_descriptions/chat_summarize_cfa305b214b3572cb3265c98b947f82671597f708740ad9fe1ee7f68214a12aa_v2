It is available both as a prescription drug (Rx) and as an over-the-counter (OTC) antidiarrheal medication, depending on the region and formulation. While some descriptions classify it strictly as a prescription medication, others indicate its availability without a prescription, suggesting regulatory differences across markets. Regardless of its classification, its mechanism of action remains consistent: it acts on the opioid receptors in the gut to reduce intestinal motility, providing relief from acute or chronic diarrhea. The drug is widely recognized for its effectiveness in managing symptoms of diarrhea, though its use should follow medical guidance to avoid potential misuse or adverse effects.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167026, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 156, "prompt_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 330, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 110}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
