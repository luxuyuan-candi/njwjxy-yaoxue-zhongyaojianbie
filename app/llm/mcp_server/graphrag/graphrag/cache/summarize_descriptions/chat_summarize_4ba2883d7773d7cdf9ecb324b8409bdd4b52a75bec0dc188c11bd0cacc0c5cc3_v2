His work focuses on analyzing the relationship between intestinal microecology and diarrhea, drawing insights from the *Huangdi Neijing*, an ancient Chinese medical text. As one of the authors of this study, he contributes to bridging traditional Chinese medicine with modern microbiological research, particularly in understanding digestive disorders. The research explores how the *Huangdi Neijing*'s theories on diarrhea and visceral functions align with contemporary findings on gut microbiota. This interdisciplinary approach highlights his involvement in both medical tradition and scientific innovation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167193, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 160, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 346, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 122}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
