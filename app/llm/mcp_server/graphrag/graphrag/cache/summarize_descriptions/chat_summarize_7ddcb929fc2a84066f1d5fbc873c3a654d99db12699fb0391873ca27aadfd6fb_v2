The journal covers a broad spectrum of topics, including the long-term cardiovascular risks associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, the effects of antihypertensive treatments, and the relationship between weight status changes and hypertension or diabetes. It also explores specialized areas such as early-onset hypertension and its impact on midlife cognitive function, as well as hypertension in children and pregnancy.  \n\nNotably, **Hypertension** has published significant studies, including a 2018 investigation into selective mineralocorticoid receptor cofactor modulation, which elucidated the molecular basis for finerenone's antifibrotic activity. Additionally, the journal features research on home blood pressure monitoring and its association with cardiovascular outcomes.  \n\nAs an international publication, **Hypertension** serves as a key resource for researchers and clinicians, providing insights into the mechanisms, management, and broader health implications of hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases. Its scope encompasses both clinical and molecular research, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the condition.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559536, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 360, "total_tokens": 574, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 296}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
