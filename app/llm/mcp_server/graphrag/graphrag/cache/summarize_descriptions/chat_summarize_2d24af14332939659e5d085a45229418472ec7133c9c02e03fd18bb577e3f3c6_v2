These essential fatty acids are naturally found in fatty fish like salmon and tuna, as well as in fish oil supplements. Omega-3s play a significant role in lipid management, contributing to cholesterol reduction and overall cardiovascular health.  \n\nIn addition to their dietary sources, omega-3 fatty acids are also available as prescription-grade medications, such as omega-3 fatty acid ethyl ester 90 soft capsules and polyene ethyl ester soft capsules. These pharmaceutical formulations are specifically designed to lower lipid levels in patients with elevated triglycerides or other lipid disorders.  \n\nWhile omega-3s are primarily known for their cardiovascular benefits, they also serve as vital nutrients for brain function and inflammation regulation. The dual availability of omega-3s—both as natural dietary components and as regulated medical treatments—highlights their versatility in promoting health.  \n\nIn summary, **OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS** encompass a group of essential polyunsaturated fats with applications in both nutrition and medicine. They are derived from fish and fish oil, support cholesterol management, and are formulated into prescription drugs for targeted lipid-lowering therapy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167346, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 271, "prompt_tokens": 237, "total_tokens": 508, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 173}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
