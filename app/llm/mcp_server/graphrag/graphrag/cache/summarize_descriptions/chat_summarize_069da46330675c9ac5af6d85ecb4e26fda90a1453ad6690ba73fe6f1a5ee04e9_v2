It is primarily used to reduce elevated triglyceride levels in the blood and is often prescribed in combination with statins or ω-3 fatty acids for the treatment of mixed hyperlipidemia. By targeting lipid metabolism, fenofibrate helps manage dyslipidemia and supports cardiovascular health. Its dual role as a standalone therapy and a complementary treatment alongside other lipid-lowering agents makes it a versatile option for patients with hypertriglyceridemia or mixed lipid disorders.
