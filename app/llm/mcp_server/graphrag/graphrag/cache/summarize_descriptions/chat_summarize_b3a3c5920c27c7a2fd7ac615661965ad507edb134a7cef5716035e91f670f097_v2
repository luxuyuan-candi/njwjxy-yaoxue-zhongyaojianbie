ABPM is particularly useful for diagnosing conditions such as white-coat hypertension (elevated blood pressure in clinical settings), masked hypertension (normal blood pressure in clinics but elevated elsewhere), and nocturnal hypertension (abnormally high blood pressure during sleep).  \n\nThe monitoring process involves taking measurements at regular intervals—typically every 15-20 minutes during waking hours and every 30 minutes during sleep. To ensure reliability, valid readings must cover at least 80% of the total monitoring duration, with a minimum of 20 daytime readings and 7 nighttime readings. ABPM provides comprehensive data, including average systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure values over a 24-hour period, as well as separate averages for daytime (awake) and nighttime (sleep) periods.  \n\nBy offering continuous, real-world blood pressure assessment, ABPM helps clinicians make more accurate diagnoses and tailor treatment plans for patients with hypertension-related conditions.
