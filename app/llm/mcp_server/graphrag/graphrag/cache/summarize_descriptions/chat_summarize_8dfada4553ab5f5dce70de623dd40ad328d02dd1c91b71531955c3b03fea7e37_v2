While historically significant, TCAs are now generally considered a second-line treatment for depression due to their side effect profile. They are known to have significant anticholinergic effects and carry a risk of cardiac toxicity, making them less suitable for elderly patients. Additionally, drug interactions may occur, such as increased blood concentrations when TCAs are co-administered with fluvoxamine. Despite their limitations, TCAs remain an important part of psychiatric pharmacotherapy in specific clinical scenarios.  \n\n*(Note: The Chinese text translates to \"Tricyclic antidepressants, which may have increased blood concentrations when used with fluvoxamine.\" This has been incorporated into the summary.)*", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559393, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 234, "total_tokens": 401, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 170}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
