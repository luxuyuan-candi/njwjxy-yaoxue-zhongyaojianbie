Deep vein thrombosis, the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein—often in the legs—can lead to pulmonary embolism, a severe and potentially life-threatening complication. This occurs when a clot breaks loose, travels through the bloodstream, and lodges in the pulmonary arteries, obstructing blood flow to the lungs. Both descriptions emphasize this causal relationship, noting that DVT is a significant risk factor for PE. In particular, patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or other high-risk conditions may be especially vulnerable to this progression. The combined risk underscores the importance of early detection and preventive measures for DVT to reduce the likelihood of pulmonary embolism.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167661, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 341, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 116}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
