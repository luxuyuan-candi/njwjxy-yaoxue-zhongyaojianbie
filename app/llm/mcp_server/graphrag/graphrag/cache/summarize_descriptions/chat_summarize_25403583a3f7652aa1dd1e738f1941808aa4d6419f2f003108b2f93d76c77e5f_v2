One notable study featured in the journal focused on the application of **repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS) combined with intensive swallowing rehabilitation** for the treatment of **poststroke dysphagia**. The research highlights the potential of this combined approach in improving swallowing function in stroke patients, underscoring the journal's role in disseminating cutting-edge findings in neuromodulation therapies.  \n\nThe journal serves as a platform for advancing scientific and clinical knowledge in neuromodulation, with a particular emphasis on non-invasive and interdisciplinary treatment methods. The study on rPMS and swallowing rehabilitation exemplifies its commitment to exploring novel interventions for neurological and functional impairments.  \n\n(Word count: 118)", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167586, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 357, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 129}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
