Both techniques serve as valuable tools for assessing blood pressure in real-world environments, providing more comprehensive data than single clinic readings.  \n\nABPM involves wearing a portable device that automatically records blood pressure at regular intervals over a 24-hour period, offering insights into fluctuations throughout daily activities and sleep. HBPM, on the other hand, relies on patients measuring their own blood pressure at home using a validated device, typically following a structured schedule.  \n\nThese methods are commonly employed to confirm diagnoses such as resistant hypertension, where blood pressure remains elevated despite treatment. Additionally, they help detect white-coat hypertension (elevated readings in clinical settings only) and masked hypertension (normal readings in clinics but elevated elsewhere). By providing a more accurate representation of a patient's blood pressure patterns, ABPM and HBPM assist healthcare providers in making informed treatment decisions.  \n\nWhile the descriptions provided are largely consistent, they collectively emphasize that both ABPM and HBPM serve the dual purpose of **confirming hypertension diagnoses** and **ongoing blood pressure monitoring** outside the clinic. The repeated mention of their role in non-clinical settings underscores their importance in improving diagnostic accuracy and long-term management of hypertension.  \n\nIn summary, ABPM and HBPM are complementary techniques that enhance blood pressure assessment by capturing real-world measurements, aiding in both diagnosis and continuous monitoring for better patient care.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167626, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 314, "prompt_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 512, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 134}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
