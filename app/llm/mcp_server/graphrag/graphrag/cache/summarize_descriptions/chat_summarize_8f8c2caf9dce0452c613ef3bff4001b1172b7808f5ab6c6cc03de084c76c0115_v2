It aids in weight loss by increasing energy expenditure and improving metabolic efficiency. Additionally, exercise plays a key role in regulating lipid levels, which contributes to better cholesterol management and reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases.  \n\nFor individuals with low daily activity, exercise serves as a therapeutic intervention to enhance overall physical fitness and mitigate sedentary lifestyle risks. It is also recommended for managing blood pressure, as regular physical activity strengthens the heart and improves circulation. Collectively, exercise is a versatile and effective approach to promoting long-term health, addressing conditions such as obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.
