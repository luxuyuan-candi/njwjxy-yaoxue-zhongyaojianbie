It is considered an effective treatment option for CKD patients, as indicated by its applicability in clinical practice (as noted in the Chinese description: \"ACEI适用于慢性肾脏病(CKD)患者\"). However, while beneficial for managing blood pressure and slowing CKD progression, ACEI may also lead to elevated blood potassium levels (hyperkalemia) as a potential side effect.
