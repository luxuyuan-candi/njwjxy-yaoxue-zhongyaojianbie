It is primarily used to treat cold-type abdominal pain, specifically addressing conditions related to spleen-stomach deficiency with cold (脾胃虚寒) and internal retention of water-dampness (水湿内停). The formula is designed to warm the middle jiao (中焦), dispel cold, and alleviate pain caused by these imbalances.  \n\nCombining the provided descriptions, 附子粳米汤 serves as a therapeutic remedy for abdominal discomfort stemming from cold and dampness accumulation, particularly in cases where the spleen and stomach are weakened by cold. Its application reflects classical Chinese medicine principles, emphasizing the restoration of yang energy and the resolution of pathogenic cold-damp factors.  \n\nThe formula's dual focus on warming and resolving dampness makes it a targeted treatment for specific patterns of abdominal pain, aligning with Zhang Zhongjing's broader contributions to cold damage (伤寒) and internal medicine in traditional Chinese medical theory. No contradictions exist between the descriptions; instead, they complement each other by providing clinical context (cold-type pain) and syndrome differentiation (spleen-stomach deficiency with dampness).  \n\nIn summary, 附子粳米汤 is a well-established herbal prescription for cold-induced abdominal pain with underlying spleen-stomach deficiency and dampness retention, rooted in classical Chinese medical texts.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167473, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 275, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 455, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 116}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
