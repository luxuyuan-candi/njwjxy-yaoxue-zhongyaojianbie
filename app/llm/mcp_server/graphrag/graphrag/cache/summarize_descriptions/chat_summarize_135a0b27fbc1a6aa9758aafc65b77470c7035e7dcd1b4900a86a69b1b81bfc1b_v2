It was formulated by **李东垣** (Lǐ Dōngyuán), a renowned physician in traditional Chinese medicine, specifically for regulating and strengthening the spleen and stomach.  \n\nThe formula comprises key herbal ingredients such as **astragalus** (huáng qí), **ginseng** (rén shēn), and **licorice** (gān cǎo), among others, which work synergistically to enhance digestive function, improve energy levels, and support overall vitality. Its primary applications include addressing fatigue, poor appetite, prolapse disorders (such as organ prolapse or chronic diarrhea), and conditions stemming from spleen qi deficiency.  \n\nAs a foundational remedy in Chinese medicine, 补中益气汤 is widely used in clinical practice to restore balance in cases of qi depletion and weakened digestive function. Its dual role in both tonifying and regulating the middle jiao (spleen-stomach system) makes it a versatile and enduring prescription in herbal medicine.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167475, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 239, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 432, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 129}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
