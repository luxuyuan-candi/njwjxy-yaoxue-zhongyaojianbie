It encompasses a range of symptoms, including a feeling of fullness, bloating, or burning sensations, often occurring during or after meals. While generally not serious, dyspepsia can cause significant discomfort and may be associated with underlying conditions such as gastritis, acid reflux, or peptic ulcers. The term is broadly used to describe functional digestive disturbances when no specific cause is identified.
