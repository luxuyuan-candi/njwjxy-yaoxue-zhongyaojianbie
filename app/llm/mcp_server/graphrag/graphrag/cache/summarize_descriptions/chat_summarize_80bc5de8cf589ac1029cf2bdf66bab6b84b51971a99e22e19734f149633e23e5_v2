It is closely linked to hypertension, with long-term high blood pressure contributing to its development, particularly through complications such as left ventricular hypertrophy. Heart failure is also a potential complication of aortic stenosis due to increased cardiac workload.  \n\nThe condition is classified into subtypes, including **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)** and **heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)**. Treatment strategies vary depending on the subtype but commonly include medications such as **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**, **angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)**, **angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs)**, and **mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)**, particularly for HFrEF. These therapies aim to improve outcomes and reduce mortality.  \n\nHeart failure has a rising prevalence in China and globally, with its risk significantly influenced by blood pressure levels. Proactive blood pressure management can help lower the likelihood of developing this condition. Overall, heart failure remains a major medical concern due to its chronic nature, association with hypertension, and the need for targeted pharmacological interventions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559443, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 247, "prompt_tokens": 292, "total_tokens": 539, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 228}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
