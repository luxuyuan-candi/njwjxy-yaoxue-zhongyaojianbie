Known for its cardiovascular and digestive benefits, it is a key component in both dietary and therapeutic applications.  \n\nAs a **medicinal herb**, 山楂 is commonly prescribed in TCM, typically in doses of **9–12g**, and is included in formulations such as **正心泰胶囊 (Zhengxin Tai Capsule)** for its cardiovascular effects. It is particularly effective in treating **hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol)**, especially for patterns such as **phlegm-turbidity obstruction (痰浊内阻型)**, **phlegm-stasis intermingling (痰瘀互结型)**, **qi stagnation and blood stasis (气滞血瘀型)**, **qi deficiency and blood stasis (气虚血瘀型)**, **liver-kidney yin deficiency (肝肾阴虚型)**, and **spleen deficiency with dampness (脾虚湿盛型)**. Its therapeutic properties include **promoting digestion, reducing blood lipids, resolving stasis, and softening blood vessels**.  \n\nAs a **food-medicine substance (食药物质)**, 山楂 is incorporated into various **dishes, teas, and health-promoting recipes** due to its dual role as a flavor enhancer and functional ingredient. Its tart flavor makes it a popular addition to beverages and culinary preparations, while its **health benefits**—such as aiding digestion and supporting cardiovascular health—reinforce its widespread use.  \n\nIn summary, 山楂 is a **multifunctional** ingredient valued in both TCM and cuisine, serving as a natural remedy for metabolic and circulatory disorders while also enriching dietary practices. Its applications span from clinical prescriptions to everyday wellness, making it a cornerstone of traditional Chinese health practices.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167143, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 376, "prompt_tokens": 305, "total_tokens": 681, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 241}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
