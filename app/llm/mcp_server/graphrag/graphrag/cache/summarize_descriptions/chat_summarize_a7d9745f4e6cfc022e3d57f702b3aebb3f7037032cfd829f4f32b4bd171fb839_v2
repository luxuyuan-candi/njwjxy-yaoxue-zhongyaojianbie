In 2015, EULAR collaborated with the **American College of Rheumatology (ACR)** to establish updated classification criteria for gout, a common form of inflammatory arthritis. This joint effort aimed to standardize the diagnosis and classification of gout, ensuring consistency in clinical practice and research. Both descriptions highlight EULAR's role as a key contributor to these guidelines, emphasizing its partnership with ACR in developing evidence-based criteria to improve patient care. The summaries align in their portrayal of EULAR as an influential organization in rheumatology, actively engaged in international collaborations to refine disease classification and management.  \n\nNo contradictions were found between the descriptions, as both consistently reference EULAR's collaboration with ACR in 2015 to develop gout classification standards.
