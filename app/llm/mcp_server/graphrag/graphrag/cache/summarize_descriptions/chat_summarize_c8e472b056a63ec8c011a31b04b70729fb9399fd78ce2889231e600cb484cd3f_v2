It plays a pivotal role in developing and updating clinical guidelines and classification criteria for rheumatic diseases, including gout. The ACR first established classification standards for gout in 1977, laying the foundation for diagnostic and management practices. In 2015, the organization collaborated with the **European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)** to co-develop updated gout classification criteria, reflecting advancements in medical understanding and practice.  \n\nThe ACR is recognized for its authoritative guidelines on the management of gout, providing evidence-based recommendations to healthcare professionals. These guidelines help standardize care, improve patient outcomes, and ensure consistency in diagnosis and treatment. By working alongside international organizations like EULAR, the ACR demonstrates its commitment to global collaboration in rheumatology research and clinical practice.  \n\nIn summary, the **American College of Rheumatology** is a leading professional body that has contributed significantly to the classification and management of gout, both through its early standards in 1977 and its collaborative efforts in 2015.
