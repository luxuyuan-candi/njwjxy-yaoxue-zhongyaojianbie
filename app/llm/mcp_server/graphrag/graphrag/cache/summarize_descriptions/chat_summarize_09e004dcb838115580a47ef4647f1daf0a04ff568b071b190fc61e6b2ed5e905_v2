It is recognized as a potential adverse effect of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), particularly spironolactone, though this risk can be mitigated by the use of finerenone. Additionally, hyperkalemia serves as a contraindication for the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), as these medications may exacerbate elevated potassium levels. Thus, managing hyperkalemia is critical when prescribing MRAs, ARBs, or ACEIs to ensure patient safety.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559478, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 124, "prompt_tokens": 170, "total_tokens": 294, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 106}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
