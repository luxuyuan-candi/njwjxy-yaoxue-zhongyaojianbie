These inhibitors work by reducing the intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol, thereby complementing the mechanism of statins, which primarily inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver.  \n\nThe primary clinical application of cholesterol absorption inhibitors is to enhance LDL-C reduction in patients who do not reach their treatment goals with statins alone. By combining these two drug classes, a synergistic effect is achieved, leading to improved lipid management. This approach is particularly beneficial for individuals with hypercholesterolemia or those at high risk of cardiovascular disease.  \n\nWhile the descriptions emphasize their role in combination therapy, they consistently highlight that cholesterol absorption inhibitors are not typically used as standalone treatments but rather as supplementary agents to optimize cholesterol-lowering regimens. Their use is well-supported in clinical guidelines for patients requiring additional LDL-C reduction beyond what statins alone can provide.  \n\nIn summary, cholesterol absorption inhibitors serve as an effective adjunct to statin therapy, offering a dual mechanism to manage elevated LDL-C levels and improve cardiovascular outcomes. Their role is firmly established in cases where statin monotherapy proves insufficient.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167337, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 256, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 432, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 112}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
