The study investigates the therapeutic effects of combining repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation (rPMS) with intensive swallowing rehabilitation for patients suffering from poststroke dysphagia, a condition characterized by difficulty swallowing after a stroke. As a contributing author, Momosaki R played a role in examining the potential benefits of this non-invasive neuromodulation technique in improving swallowing function. The research underscores the significance of interdisciplinary rehabilitation approaches in stroke recovery.
