This joint effort was undertaken to establish a standardized and evidence-based framework for diagnosing and classifying gout, a common form of inflammatory arthritis. By combining their expertise, the two organizations aimed to improve clinical consistency and research comparability in the field of rheumatology.  \n\nThe collaboration between ACR and EULAR resulted in the publication of the **2015 gout classification criteria**, which integrated clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings to enhance diagnostic accuracy. These criteria were designed to replace older, less precise methods and provide a more reliable tool for healthcare professionals worldwide. The partnership underscores the importance of international cooperation in advancing medical guidelines and improving patient care.  \n\nBoth descriptions confirm the joint nature of this initiative, with no contradictions in the provided information.
