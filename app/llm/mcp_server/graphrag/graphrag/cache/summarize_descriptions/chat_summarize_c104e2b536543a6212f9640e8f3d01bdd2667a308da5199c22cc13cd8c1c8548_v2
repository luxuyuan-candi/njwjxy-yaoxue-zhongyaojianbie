It is recognized as one of the \"three highs\" (alongside hypertension and hyperlipidemia) that contribute to significant health risks, including cardiovascular disease and organ damage. Additionally, 高血糖 can arise as a metabolic side effect of corticosteroid therapy, which may disrupt insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation.  \n\nWhile diabetes is a primary cause of 高血糖, the condition can also occur in non-diabetic individuals due to medications, stress, or other underlying health issues. Managing 高血糖 typically involves lifestyle modifications, medication, and monitoring to prevent complications. The dual association—both as a hallmark of diabetes and a drug-induced side effect—highlights its multifaceted nature in clinical and metabolic contexts.  \n\n(Word count: 120)", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752166982, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 175, "prompt_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 349, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 110}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
