They work by inhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which breaks down neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, thereby increasing their availability in the brain. MAOIs are considered an older class of antidepressants but remain effective for certain patients, particularly those who do not respond to other treatments.  \n\nHowever, MAOIs have significant dietary and drug interaction restrictions. Notably, they should not be combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram, due to the risk of serotonin syndromeâ€”a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin levels. Additionally, MAOIs require strict adherence to dietary guidelines to avoid interactions with tyramine-rich foods (e.g., aged cheeses, cured meats), which can lead to dangerous increases in blood pressure.  \n\nDespite these limitations, MAOIs remain a valuable option in psychiatric treatment, particularly for treatment-resistant depression. Their use is carefully monitored to ensure patient safety.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167567, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 213, "prompt_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 419, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 142}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
