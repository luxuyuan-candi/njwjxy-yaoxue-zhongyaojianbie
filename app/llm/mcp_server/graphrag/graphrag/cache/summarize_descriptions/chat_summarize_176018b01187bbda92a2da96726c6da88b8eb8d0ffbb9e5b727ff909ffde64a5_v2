Recognized as both a medicinal food and a miscellaneous bean, it holds significant value in health and dietary applications.  \n\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, 赤小豆 is known for its therapeutic properties, particularly its ability to **strengthen the spleen (健脾)** and **resolve dampness (化湿)**. It is often recommended for dietary adjustments during the long summer season (长夏膳食调理) to address imbalances related to dampness and spleen deficiency. Additionally, it is specifically noted as beneficial for individuals with **hyperlipidemia (高脂血症)**, particularly those exhibiting **phlegm-dampness obstruction (痰浊内阻型)** or **spleen deficiency with dampness excess (脾虚湿盛型)**.\n\nBeyond its medicinal uses, 赤小豆 is a versatile ingredient in food preparation, commonly incorporated into soups, desserts, and other dishes. Its dual classification as both a medicinal substance and a culinary bean underscores its importance in promoting health through diet.  \n\nOverall, 赤小豆 serves as a functional food with well-documented therapeutic effects, bridging the gap between nutrition and traditional medicine in Chinese culture.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167263, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 256, "prompt_tokens": 230, "total_tokens": 486, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 166}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
