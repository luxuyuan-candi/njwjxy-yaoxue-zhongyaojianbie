As a key metabolic enzyme, it plays a significant role in drug processing, and its activity can be influenced by inhibitors and inducers. Notably, **gemfibrozil metabolites** are known to inhibit CYP2C8, which can lead to a substantial slowdown in the metabolism of drugs processed by this enzyme. This inhibition has clinical implications, particularly for medications like repaglinide, where altered metabolism may affect drug efficacy and safety.  \n\nCYP2C8 is recognized for its broad involvement in the metabolism of multiple pharmaceuticals, though specific inhibitors and inducers beyond gemfibrozil are not detailed in the provided descriptions. The enzyme's function is consistent across different sources, with no major contradictions in its role or interactions. Additionally, it is referenced in both English and Chinese contexts (as \"CYP2C8是一种代谢酶，参与多种药物的代谢\"), further confirming its widespread recognition in drug metabolism.  \n\nIn summary, **CYP2C8** is a critical hepatic enzyme responsible for metabolizing several drugs, with its activity modifiable by inhibitors such as gemfibrozil metabolites. Understanding its function and interactions is essential for predicting drug behavior and optimizing therapeutic outcomes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167517, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 271, "prompt_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 514, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 115}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
