It serves multiple purposes, including identifying white-coat hypertension (elevated blood pressure in clinical settings but not at home) and assessing morning hypertension, a critical factor in cardiovascular risk evaluation. HBPM is also studied in conjunction with internet-based healthcare solutions to enhance hypertension management. Additionally, it holds significant value in diagnosing and evaluating treatment efficacy for elderly patients with hypertension, as noted in clinical studies. Overall, HBPM is a versatile tool that supports accurate diagnosis, ongoing monitoring, and personalized care for individuals with hypertension.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559457, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 132, "prompt_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 360, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 100}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
