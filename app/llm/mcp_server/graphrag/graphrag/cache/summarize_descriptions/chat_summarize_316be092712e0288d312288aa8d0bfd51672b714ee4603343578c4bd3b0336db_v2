It accelerates atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which narrows and hardens them, directly increasing the likelihood of CHD. Multiple descriptions emphasize that high lipidemia not only raises the risk of CHD but also acts as a key source or underlying cause of the condition. Left untreated, high lipidemia further exacerbates this risk, underscoring the importance of managing lipid levels to prevent or mitigate coronary heart disease.  \n\nWhile some descriptions state that high lipidemia \"can lead to\" or \"increases the risk of\" CHD, others describe it as a \"direct cause\" or \"major contributor.\" These variations do not contradict but rather reinforce the strong, well-established relationship between the two conditions. Collectively, the evidence highlights high lipidemia as a critical modifiable factor in the prevention and progression of coronary heart disease.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753518010, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 208, "prompt_tokens": 251, "total_tokens": 459, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 187}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
