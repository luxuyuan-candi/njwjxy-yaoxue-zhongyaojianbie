They are transported in chylomicrons after meals and in very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) during fasting. While triglycerides are necessary for normal bodily functions, elevated levels can contribute to **hyperlipidemia** (high lipid levels) and are associated with an increased risk of **cardiovascular disease**.  \n\nNormal triglyceride levels vary by sex: for males, they range from **0.45–1.81 mmol/L (40–160 mg/dL)**, and for females, they range from **0.23–1.2 mmol/L (20–108 mg/dL)**. High levels can result from factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and smoking, as nicotine and carbon monoxide stimulate fatty acid release, further elevating triglyceride concentrations.  \n\nLifestyle modifications, including a balanced diet and regular physical activity, can help manage and reduce triglyceride levels, thereby lowering cardiovascular risk. Maintaining healthy triglyceride levels is crucial for metabolic health and overall well-being.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167368, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 230, "prompt_tokens": 383, "total_tokens": 613, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 319}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
