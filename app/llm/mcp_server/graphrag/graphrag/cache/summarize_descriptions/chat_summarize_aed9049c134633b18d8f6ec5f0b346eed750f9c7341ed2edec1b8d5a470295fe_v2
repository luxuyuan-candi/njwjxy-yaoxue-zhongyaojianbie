As a CYP3A4/5 inhibitor, it significantly slows the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates of these enzymes, potentially leading to increased plasma concentrations and prolonged effects of co-administered medications. This pharmacokinetic interaction is clinically important, as it may necessitate dose adjustments or close monitoring to avoid adverse effects or toxicity when伏立康唑 is used concomitantly with other drugs metabolized by CYP3A4/5. The descriptions consistently emphasize its role as a \"strong inhibitor\" of these enzymes, underscoring its impact on drug-drug interactions. The term \"Voriconazole\" is the non-proprietary name for伏立康唑, confirming their identity as the same entity.
