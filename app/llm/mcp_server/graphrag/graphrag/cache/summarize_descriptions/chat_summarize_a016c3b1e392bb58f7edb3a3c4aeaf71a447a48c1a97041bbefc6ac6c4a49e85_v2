It has a variable prevalence, ranging from 1.14% in elderly populations to 2.5%-7.8% in the general adult population, with higher rates observed among men, overweight or obese individuals, and younger age groups (particularly those aged 40-49). IDH is strongly associated with metabolic syndrome and poses an increased cardiovascular risk, especially in younger patients under 50 years of age.  \n\nThe condition significantly elevates the risk of stroke, cardiovascular death, and composite cardiovascular events, with studies highlighting a pronounced impact among Asian populations and individuals under 55. Management typically involves lifestyle interventions, though drug therapy may be recommended for high-risk patients.
