It is also effective in managing conditions related to aldosterone excess. Additionally, spironolactone may improve obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) severity and blood pressure. While it serves as a fourth-line treatment for hypertension, its use can be limited by intolerable side effects, prompting the consideration of alternatives like eplerenone.
