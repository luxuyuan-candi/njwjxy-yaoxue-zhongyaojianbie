The nation has implemented proactive health measures, including the **National Cholesterol Education Program**, which treats diabetes in high-cholesterol patients as equivalent to coronary disease, emphasizing the importance of early intervention.  \n\nFrom **1974 to 1993**, the U.S. experienced a significant decline in CHD and stroke mortality rates, reflecting advancements in medical research, public health initiatives, and preventive care. To further mitigate risks, the country recommends **lipid checks for children aged 2 and above** if they exhibit high-risk factors for CHD, underscoring a focus on early detection and management.  \n\nAdditionally, the U.S. invests heavily in cardiovascular health, spending **over $2 billion annually** on lipid-lowering treatments. This substantial financial commitment highlights the prioritization of combating cholesterol-related conditions and improving long-term public health outcomes. Collectively, these efforts demonstrate the nation's comprehensive approach to reducing coronary heart disease through prevention, education, and medical intervention.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167390, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 219, "prompt_tokens": 246, "total_tokens": 465, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 182}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
