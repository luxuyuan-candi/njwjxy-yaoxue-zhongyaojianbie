It is widely used in Chinese medicine for its therapeutic properties, primarily to **regulate qi**, **transform phlegm**, and **resolve dampness**.  \n\nIn clinical practice, **陈皮** is often incorporated into herbal formulations, such as **补中益气汤 (Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang)**, where it aids in balancing qi and enhancing digestive function. Its dual role in both **regulating qi** and **addressing dampness** makes it a versatile ingredient in treatments for digestive disorders, respiratory conditions, and other imbalances related to qi stagnation or phlegm accumulation.  \n\nWhile the descriptions vary slightly—some emphasizing its use for **phlegm transformation**, others highlighting its role in **dampness resolution**—they collectively underscore **陈皮**'s importance in promoting qi flow and alleviating related symptoms. The herb's applications are consistent across contexts, with no significant contradictions in its traditional uses.  \n\nOverall, **陈皮** remains a fundamental component of Chinese herbal medicine, valued for its ability to harmonize bodily functions and support overall wellness.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167480, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 234, "prompt_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 417, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 55}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
