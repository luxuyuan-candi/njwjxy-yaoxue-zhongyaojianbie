It is a potential complication in patients with **intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)** or those who have suffered a **stroke**, often due to prolonged immobility during recovery. DVT can lead to life-threatening complications, such as **pulmonary embolism (PE)**, if a clot dislodges and travels to the lungs.  \n\nTo mitigate the risk of DVT in high-risk patients, preventive measures are essential. These include **early mobilization** to improve circulation and the use of **compression stockings** to reduce venous stasis. Prophylactic strategies are particularly critical in stroke and ICH patients, as their reduced mobility increases susceptibility to clot formation.  \n\nIn summary, DVT is a significant post-stroke and post-ICH complication requiring vigilant monitoring and preventive interventions to avoid severe outcomes like pulmonary embolism.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167207, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 383, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 123}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
