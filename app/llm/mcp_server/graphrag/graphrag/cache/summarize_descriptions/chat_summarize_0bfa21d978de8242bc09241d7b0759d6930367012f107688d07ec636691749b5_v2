Both descriptions emphasize the strong association between hypertension and the development of cardiovascular diseases, reinforcing that elevated blood pressure contributes to the likelihood of CVD. The slight variation in phrasing—whether referring to \"cardiovascular disease\" (singular) or \"cardiovascular diseases\" (plural)—does not alter the core relationship, as hypertension is widely recognized as a key contributor to various cardiovascular conditions, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke.  \n\nIn summary, hypertension plays a critical role in increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease, underscoring the importance of blood pressure management in preventing CVD-related complications.
