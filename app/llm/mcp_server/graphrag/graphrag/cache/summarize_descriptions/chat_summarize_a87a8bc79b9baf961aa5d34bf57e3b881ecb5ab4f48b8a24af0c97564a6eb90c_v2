This process helps reduce the buildup of plaque in arteries, thereby lowering the risk of cardiovascular diseases. HDL is also known to be protective against coronary heart disease, with medical guidelines recommending a minimum level of **≥1.04 mmol/L (40 mg/dL)** to maintain optimal health. Higher HDL levels are generally associated with better cardiovascular outcomes, as they contribute to the efficient transport and elimination of excess cholesterol from the body.  \n\nIn summary, HDL serves as a critical component in maintaining heart health by counteracting the harmful effects of LDL and supporting overall cholesterol balance. Maintaining adequate HDL levels is an important factor in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease and promoting long-term cardiovascular well-being.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167412, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 176, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 365, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 61}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
