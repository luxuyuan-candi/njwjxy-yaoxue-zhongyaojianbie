It facilitates the transport of various organic anions, including pharmaceuticals, influencing their absorption, distribution, and excretion. OATP1B1 is primarily expressed in the liver, where it mediates the uptake of drugs and other compounds from the blood into hepatocytes, thereby affecting their pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy. This transporter is essential for the hepatic clearance of many drugs, making it a key factor in drug-drug interactions and variability in drug response among individuals.  \n\nThe descriptions highlight its dual role in both drug distribution and excretion, as well as its specific function in hepatic drug uptake. Collectively, OATP1B1 is recognized as a significant transporter protein that impacts drug metabolism and disposition, with implications for pharmacology and personalized medicine.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517979, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 186, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 366, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 116}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
