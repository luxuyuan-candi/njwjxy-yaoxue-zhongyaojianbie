This condition is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) due to the combined effects of high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Management typically requires a combination of pharmacological therapies, as single-agent treatments may not adequately address both lipid abnormalities. The disorder underscores the importance of comprehensive lipid-lowering strategies to mitigate cardiovascular risks.  \n\nThe two provided descriptions align in their definition of mixed hyperlipidemia as a dual elevation of cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as its clinical implications for ASCVD risk. Both also emphasize the necessity of combination drug therapy for effective management, reinforcing the complexity of treating this condition.
