This condition is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, particularly atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. While often asymptomatic in its early stages, untreated hyperlipidemia can lead to serious health complications.  \n\nSpecific thresholds for cholesterol and LDL levels are used to assess an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease. High lipid levels contribute to the buildup of plaque in the arteries (atherosclerosis), narrowing blood vessels and increasing the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes. Management typically involves lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes and increased physical activity, along with medications like statins when necessary.
