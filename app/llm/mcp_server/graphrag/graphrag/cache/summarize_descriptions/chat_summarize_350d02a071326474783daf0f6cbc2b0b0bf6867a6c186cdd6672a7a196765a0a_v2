These welts, often raised and varying in size, can emerge suddenly and may be triggered by allergic reactions, stress, infections, or other underlying factors. While urticaria is generally considered a mild and temporary condition, it can cause significant discomfort due to the intense itching associated with the welts. The condition is widely recognized as a frequent dermatological issue, though its severity and duration can vary from person to person. In most cases, urticaria resolves on its own or with basic treatment, but persistent or severe cases may require medical attention to identify and address the root cause.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167017, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 175, "total_tokens": 326, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 111}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
