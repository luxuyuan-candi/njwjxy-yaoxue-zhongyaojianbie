The most commonly cited version is the **17-item HAMD**, which evaluates various symptoms of depression, including mood, guilt, insomnia, agitation, and other psychological and physical indicators. This scale serves as a standardized method for clinicians to quantify depression levels, track patient progress over time, and guide treatment decisions.  \n\nBoth descriptions confirm that HAMD is a depression rating scale, with one specifying its application in evaluating a patient's mental state (particularly the 17-item version) and the other emphasizing its broader use in assessing depression severity. The summaries align in their core purpose, differing only in minor phrasing.  \n\nIn summary, the **HAMD** is a validated, structured assessment tool primarily employed in clinical and research settings to measure depressive symptoms, with the 17-item version being a frequently utilized iteration for comprehensive evaluation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167163, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 200, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 379, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 115}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
