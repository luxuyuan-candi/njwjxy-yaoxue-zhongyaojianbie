It is widely recognized for its therapeutic properties and is often used to harmonize other ingredients in herbal formulations. One notable example is its role in **小建中汤 (Xiao Jian Zhong Tang)**, where it helps balance and enhance the effects of the other components in the formula.  \n\nIn TCM, 大枣 is valued for its sweet flavor and warming nature, which contribute to its ability to tonify the spleen and stomach, nourish the blood, and calm the mind. Its dual function as both a medicinal herb and a food highlights its versatility in promoting health. Whether used alone or in combination with other herbs, 大枣 remains a fundamental element in TCM practices.  \n\nThis summary integrates both descriptions, confirming that 大枣 is not only a medicinal fruit (jujube) but also a harmonizing agent in compound formulas like 小建中汤.
