Developed and studied by the **DASH-Sodium Collaborative Research Group**, this diet emphasizes reduced intake of saturated fat and cholesterol while being rich in essential nutrients such as potassium, magnesium, calcium, and fiber. Research has shown that adhering to the DASH diet can lead to a reduction in blood pressure within **14 days**, as well as a decreased risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Additionally, the diet has been proven effective in lowering cholesterol levels and overall cardiovascular risk.
