It is especially prevalent among elderly individuals suffering from depression, where it is often associated with severe depressive episodes, psychotic symptoms, and a lack of social support. The risk underscores the importance of thorough evaluation in clinical settings to identify vulnerable patients and implement appropriate interventions.
