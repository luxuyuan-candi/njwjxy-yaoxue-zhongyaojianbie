Specifically, the study focused on the application of this technique for managing abdominal pain associated with acute appendicitis. The research highlights the potential therapeutic benefits of combining atropine—a medication typically used to treat certain types of nerve agent and pesticide poisonings, as well as some heart conditions—with acupoint injection, a traditional Chinese medicine practice. By contributing to this study, 张亚冰 has participated in exploring alternative or complementary medical approaches for pain relief in acute appendicitis cases. The work underscores an interdisciplinary effort bridging pharmacology and traditional acupuncture techniques.
