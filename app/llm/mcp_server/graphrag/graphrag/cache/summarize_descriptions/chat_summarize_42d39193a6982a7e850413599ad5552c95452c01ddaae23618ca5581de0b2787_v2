It is a significant health concern addressed by various treatment approaches, including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and acupuncture, which aim to regulate the body's yin-yang balance during prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation stages. Hypertension is also a common manifestation of Cushing's syndrome, affecting approximately 80% of patients with the condition, and is one of the metabolic syndrome components frequently observed in individuals with gout.  \n\nIn China, hypertension is a focal point for internet-based medical services and national health policies, reflecting its widespread impact. Certain cases, such as those involving atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or acute thrombotic events, may require active antiplatelet therapy.
