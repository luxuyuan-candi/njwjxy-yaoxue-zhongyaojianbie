Arteriosclerosis, a hardening and narrowing of the arteries due to plaque buildup, is recognized as the primary cause of coronary heart disease (CHD). CHD occurs when arteriosclerosis specifically affects the coronary arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. Both conditions can be indicated by certain lipid profile results, such as elevated cholesterol or triglyceride levels, which contribute to plaque formation. Thus, arteriosclerosis serves as a foundational pathological process that often leads to the development of coronary heart disease, with shared risk factors and diagnostic markers linking the two conditions.  \n\nThis summary integrates both descriptions, clarifying their relationship: arteriosclerosis is a systemic condition that underlies CHD, and lipid abnormalities may signal the presence of either or both diseases. The explanation resolves any apparent contradiction by positioning arteriosclerosis as both a distinct condition and a causative factor for CHD.
