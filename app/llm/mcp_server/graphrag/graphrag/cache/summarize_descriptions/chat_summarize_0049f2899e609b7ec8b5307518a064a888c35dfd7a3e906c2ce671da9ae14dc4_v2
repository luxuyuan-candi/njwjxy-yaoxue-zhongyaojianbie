Smoking is often referred to as a **\"smiling killer\"** due to its substantial contribution to cardiovascular disease incidence.  \n\nStudies highlight that smoking is one of the most **reversible risk factors** for coronary atherosclerosis. Quitting smoking can lead to a **significant reduction in cardiovascular risk**, with former smokers eventually reaching a risk level comparable to that of non-smokers. Additionally, **HDL levels** can recover to normal within a year of cessation.  \n\nBeyond cardiovascular effects, smoking is also associated with **high blood pressure** and **poor cholesterol management**, making it an activity to **strictly avoid** for overall health improvement. Public health recommendations consistently emphasize smoking cessation as a critical step in reducing preventable diseases and improving long-term health outcomes.  \n\nIn summary, smoking poses severe risks to cardiovascular and metabolic health, but its effects are largely reversible upon quitting, underscoring the importance of cessation efforts.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167390, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 246, "prompt_tokens": 340, "total_tokens": 586, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 276}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
