Specifically, it is defined as hypertension that does not respond to treatment with three antihypertensive medications, one of which must be a diuretic, administered at optimal doses. This condition can be identified through home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) or clinical measurements, confirming the lack of control despite adherence to the prescribed regimen.  \n\nThe two provided descriptions align in their core definition but offer slightly different nuances. The first emphasizes the requirement for a diuretic as part of the three-drug regimen, while the second highlights the role of HBPM in detecting uncontrolled blood pressure. Combining these, resistant hypertension is best described as blood pressure that remains elevated despite the concurrent use of three antihypertensive drugs (including a diuretic) at appropriate doses, with confirmation through either clinical or home-based monitoring.  \n\nThis condition often necessitates further diagnostic evaluation to rule out secondary causes of hypertension, assess medication adherence, and consider additional or alternative treatment strategies. Resistant hypertension poses significant cardiovascular risks, making accurate diagnosis and management critical for patient outcomes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167054, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 228, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 409, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 117}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
