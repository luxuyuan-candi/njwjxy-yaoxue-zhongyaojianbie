It is a key ingredient in the **银翘散** (Yinqiao San) formula, commonly prescribed for respiratory conditions such as sore throat and cough. As a medicinal substance, 桔梗 is typically administered in doses of **6–9 grams** in TCM prescriptions.  \n\nIn addition to its respiratory benefits, 桔梗 is classified as a **food-medicine substance** (食药物质) in China, particularly recommended for managing **hyperlipidemia** (high cholesterol) in cases of **phlegm-turbidity obstruction** (痰浊内阻型) or **phlegm-stasis intermingling** (痰瘀互结型). This dual role—both as a standalone remedy and as part of compound formulas—highlights its versatility in TCM.  \n\nTo resolve any potential contradictions: while some descriptions emphasize its use for respiratory ailments, others focus on its role in metabolic disorders like hyperlipidemia. These are not conflicting but rather reflect 桔梗's broad pharmacological profile, which includes **expectorant, anti-inflammatory, and lipid-regulating properties**. Its inclusion in both classical formulas and modern dietary guidelines underscores its enduring significance in Chinese herbal medicine.  \n\nIn summary, 桔梗 is a multifaceted TCM herb with applications ranging from **cough and throat relief** to **lipid metabolism regulation**, administered in precise doses and often combined with other herbs for enhanced efficacy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167142, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 316, "prompt_tokens": 217, "total_tokens": 533, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 153}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
