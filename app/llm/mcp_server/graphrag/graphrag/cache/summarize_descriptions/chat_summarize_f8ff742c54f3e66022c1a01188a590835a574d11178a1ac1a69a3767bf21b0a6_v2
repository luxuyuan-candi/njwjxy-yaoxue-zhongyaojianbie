ESH collaborates with other leading medical societies, such as the **European Society of Cardiology (ESC)**, to provide comprehensive treatment guidelines, and with the **European Union Geriatric Medicine Society (EUGMS)** to address hypertension management in very old and frail patients. Additionally, ESH plays a key role in certifying blood pressure monitoring devices, ensuring their accuracy and reliability in clinical practice. Through its multidisciplinary collaborations and evidence-based recommendations, ESH serves as a pivotal authority in advancing hypertension care across Europe and beyond.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559446, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 166, "prompt_tokens": 317, "total_tokens": 483, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 253}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
