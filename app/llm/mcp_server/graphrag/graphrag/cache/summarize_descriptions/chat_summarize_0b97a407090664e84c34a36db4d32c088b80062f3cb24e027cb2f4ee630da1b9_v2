It is characterized by symptoms like sneezing, nasal congestion, runny nose, and itchy eyes, resulting from the immune system's overreaction to these substances. While it is primarily considered a minor ENT (ear, nose, and throat) condition, its impact on quality of life can vary widelyâ€”ranging from mild discomfort to significant impairment in daily activities, sleep, and productivity. Despite its classification as a minor condition, allergic rhinitis can contribute to complications such as sinusitis or exacerbate asthma if left unmanaged. Treatment typically involves allergen avoidance, antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids, or immunotherapy in more severe cases.  \n\n(Word count: 120)", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167019, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 173, "prompt_tokens": 171, "total_tokens": 344, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 107}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
