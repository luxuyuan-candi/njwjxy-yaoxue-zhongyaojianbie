It is primarily used to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by binding to bile acids in the intestine, preventing their reabsorption and promoting their excretion. However, while effective in reducing LDL cholesterol, cholestyramine may also lead to an increase in triglyceride levels as a potential side effect. This dual effect underscores its role as a targeted therapy for managing hypercholesterolemia while requiring monitoring for alterations in lipid profiles. The medication is commonly prescribed for conditions such as primary hypercholesterolemia and pruritus associated with partial biliary obstruction. Its oral administration and specific dosing regimen make it a structured treatment option under clinical supervision.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167466, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 160, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 350, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 126}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
