It is widely used in Chinese medicine for its therapeutic properties, particularly in addressing **spleen and stomach qi deficiency syndrome**, as well as **cold and flu symptoms**. As a key ingredient in formulations like **乌梅丸 (Wu Mei Wan)**, it is typically administered in doses of **9–12 grams**.  \n\nBeyond its role in treating qi deficiency and respiratory ailments, 党参 is also classified as a **food-medicine substance**, making it suitable for managing conditions such as **hyperlipidemia of the qi deficiency and blood stasis type**. Its dual application—both as a medicinal herb and a dietary supplement—highlights its versatility in traditional practices.  \n\nWhile descriptions vary slightly in focus (e.g., cold/flu vs. qi deficiency), they collectively emphasize 党参’s primary functions: **tonifying qi, strengthening the spleen, and supporting immune health**. The contradictions are minimal, as its uses are complementary rather than conflicting, rooted in its broad adaptogenic properties.  \n\nIn summary, 党参 is a multifaceted Chinese herb with applications ranging from digestive and respiratory health to metabolic support, reflecting its enduring role in both clinical and wellness contexts.  \n\n*(Word count: 199)*", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167136, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 271, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 494, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 159}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
