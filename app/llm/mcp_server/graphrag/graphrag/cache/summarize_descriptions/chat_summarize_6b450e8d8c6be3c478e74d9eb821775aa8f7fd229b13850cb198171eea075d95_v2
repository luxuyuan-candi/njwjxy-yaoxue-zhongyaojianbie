It is primarily known for its role in strengthening the spleen, aiding digestion, and restoring balance to the body's qi (vital energy). As a key ingredient in classical formulations, it is commonly included in compound preparations, such as **红曲与中药复合制剂** (red yeast rice and Chinese herbal compound formulations), as well as in modified prescriptions like **附子理中丸加减方** (Aconite Center-Regulating Pill variations).  \n\nThe typical dosage of 白术 ranges from **9 to 12 grams**, reflecting its standardized use in clinical practice. Its applications span both standalone prescriptions and multi-herb combinations, emphasizing its versatility in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).  \n\nIn summary, 白术 is a foundational TCM herb with a well-documented role in spleen fortification, qi regulation, and digestive support, administered in controlled doses for optimal therapeutic effect.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167137, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 215, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 438, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 159}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
