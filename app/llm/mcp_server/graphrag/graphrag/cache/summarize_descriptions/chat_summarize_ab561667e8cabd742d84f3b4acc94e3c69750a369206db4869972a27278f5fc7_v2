Its typical dosage ranges from 20 to 60 mg per day. As an SSRI, it works by increasing serotonin levels in the brain, but it also exhibits inhibitory effects on the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C19 and CYP2D6, which may influence the metabolism of other medications.  \n\n氟西汀 is generally well-tolerated, with mild appetite suppression and a low likelihood of causing weight gain—a distinguishing feature compared to some other antidepressants. Its side effect profile is similar to that of citalopram, another SSRI, and may include gastrointestinal disturbances, insomnia, or sexual dysfunction. However, caution is advised in specific populations, particularly in post-stroke depression, due to potential cardiovascular risks.  \n\nAdditionally, 氟西汀 can lead to severe adverse reactions when combined with certain medications, such as selegiline (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor), potentially resulting in hypertension, coma, or ataxia. Therefore, careful monitoring and avoidance of contraindicated drug combinations are essential.  \n\nIn summary, 氟西汀 is an effective SSRI antidepressant with a favorable weight-neutral profile but requires cautious use in patients with cardiovascular concerns or those taking interacting medications. Its pharmacokinetic properties, including CYP enzyme inhibition, further necessitate individualized dosing and close clinical supervision.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167541, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 285, "prompt_tokens": 243, "total_tokens": 528, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 115}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
