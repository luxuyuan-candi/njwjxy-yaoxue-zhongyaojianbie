It is known for its cooling properties and is often employed to clear heat and relieve symptoms such as sore throat. One of its notable applications is as a key ingredient in the **银翘散 (Yinqiao San)** formula, a classic TCM preparation used to address wind-heat syndromes, including fever, cough, and throat discomfort.  \n\nIn TCM,薄荷 is valued for its ability to disperse wind-heat, promote the eruption of rashes (in cases like measles), and soothe irritations of the throat and respiratory tract. Its dual role as both a medicinal herb and a culinary ingredient highlights its versatility. The descriptions collectively emphasize its therapeutic use in heat-clearing and throat-soothing contexts, reinforcing its importance in traditional remedies.  \n\nOverall,薄荷 is a well-regarded herb in Chinese medicine, primarily utilized for its cooling and anti-inflammatory effects, particularly in formulations targeting respiratory and febrile conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517996, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 201, "prompt_tokens": 169, "total_tokens": 370, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 105}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
