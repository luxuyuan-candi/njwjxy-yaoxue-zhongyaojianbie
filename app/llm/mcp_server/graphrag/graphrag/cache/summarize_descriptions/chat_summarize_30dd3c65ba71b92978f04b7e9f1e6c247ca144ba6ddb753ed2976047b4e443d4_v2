These drugs, which include **evolocumab**, **alirocumab**, and **toleisumab**, function by inhibiting the PCSK9 protein, thereby increasing the number of LDL receptors on cell membranes. This mechanism enhances the clearance of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from the bloodstream, leading to significant reductions in LDL-C levels.  \n\nBeyond their primary role in cholesterol management, PCSK9 inhibitors exhibit additional therapeutic effects, such as stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques, anticoagulation, and anti-inflammatory properties. These multifaceted benefits contribute to their potential in reducing cardiovascular risk.  \n\nIn summary, PCSK9 inhibitors are a clinically recognized class of drugs that effectively lower LDL-C while offering secondary cardiovascular protective effects. Their inclusion in treatment guidelines underscores their importance in managing hypercholesterolemia and related conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167330, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 185, "prompt_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 416, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 103}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
