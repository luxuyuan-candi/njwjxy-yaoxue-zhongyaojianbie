Recognized as a medicinal and edible substance, it is particularly noted for its therapeutic applications in managing specific types of hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol). According to traditional Chinese medicine, 昆布 is suitable for treating conditions such as \"痰浊内阻型\" (phlegm-dampness obstruction), \"痰瘀互结型\" (phlegm-stasis combination), and \"气虚血瘀型\" (qi deficiency with blood stasis) hyperlipidemia.
