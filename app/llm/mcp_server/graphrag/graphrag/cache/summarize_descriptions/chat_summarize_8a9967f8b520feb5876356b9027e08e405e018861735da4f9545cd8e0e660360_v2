The condition is closely linked to high cholesterol, further exacerbating cardiovascular risks.  \n\nWhile high blood pressure can affect a wide range of people, certain lifestyle and genetic factors heighten susceptibility. Managing the condition often involves dietary changes, weight management, and, in some cases, medication to reduce long-term health complications.
