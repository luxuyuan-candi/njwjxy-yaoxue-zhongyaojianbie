It represents the final stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD), often progressing from earlier stages of CKD when left unmanaged. Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a known exacerbating factor that can accelerate the progression to ESRD. Additionally, in diabetic patients, SGLT2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) medications have shown potential in helping to prevent the onset of ESRD by mitigating kidney damage.
