There is a strong association between the two disorders, with studies indicating that 50-80% of OSAS patients also have hypertension, while 30-50% of hypertensive patients have OSAS. The relationship between OSAS and hypertension is bidirectional, meaning each condition can influence the other. They share common pathophysiological mechanisms, further reinforcing their interconnected nature.
