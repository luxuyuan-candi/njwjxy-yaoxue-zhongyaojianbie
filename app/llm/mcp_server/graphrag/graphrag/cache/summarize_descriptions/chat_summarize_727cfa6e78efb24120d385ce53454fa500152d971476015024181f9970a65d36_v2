ABPM evaluates blood pressure variability, circadian rhythm, and arterial elasticity function, providing a comprehensive assessment of a patient's blood pressure patterns during daily activities, including daytime light physical activity and nighttime sleep. Additionally, it is useful for diagnosing and evaluating patients with sleep disorders or those who work night shifts, as it captures blood pressure fluctuations during both waking and sleeping hours.
