These techniques are clinically recommended for further examination of individuals who exhibit positive results in preliminary screenings like the water swallow test (Ⅰ级推荐, A级证据).  \n\nWhile both methods serve the same primary purpose—assessing swallowing dysfunction—they differ in practicality and application. VFSS utilizes X-ray imaging to visualize the swallowing process in real time, providing a dynamic assessment of oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases. In contrast, FEES employs a flexible endoscope to directly observe pharyngeal and laryngeal structures during swallowing, making it a more portable and cost-effective alternative.  \n\nFEES is often preferred in settings where radiation exposure is a concern or when bedside evaluation is necessary due to its ease of transport. However, VFSS remains valuable for its ability to capture the entire swallowing sequence, including the esophageal phase, which FEES cannot assess. Both methods are considered reliable and are used interchangeably depending on clinical needs, patient condition, and resource availability.  \n\nIn summary, VFSS and FEES are complementary diagnostic tools for swallowing disorders, with FEES offering portability and cost advantages, while VFSS provides a more comprehensive visualization of the swallowing mechanism. Their selection depends on specific clinical scenarios, but both are endorsed as effective evaluation methods.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167809, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 309, "prompt_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 550, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 177}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
