These medications are commonly employed in **hypertension subemergency cases** to control blood pressure effectively. Additionally, they are often **combined in hypertension treatment regimens** to enhance therapeutic outcomes.  \n\nHowever, it is important to note that both **CCB and ACEI can interact with anesthesia during surgery**, which necessitates careful management in perioperative settings.
