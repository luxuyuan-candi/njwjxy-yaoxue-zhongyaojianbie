It serves multiple purposes, including identifying conditions such as white coat hypertension, masked hypertension, and resistant hypertension, as well as evaluating long-term blood pressure variability, assessing the efficacy of antihypertensive treatments, and predicting cardiovascular risk and prognosis. The diagnostic threshold for hypertension via HBPM is an average systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥135 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥85 mmHg.  \n\nHBPM can be performed by patients themselves or with the assistance of family members, making it a flexible and accessible tool for self-measured or home-based blood pressure assessment. It plays a significant role in enhancing patient health awareness, improving treatment adherence, and facilitating long-term blood pressure management. Additionally, HBPM is recognized as both a self-management tool for patients and an auxiliary diagnostic method for hypertension.  \n\nWith advancements in telemetry technology, internet-based remote HBPM and management systems are emerging as potential future models for blood pressure control. However, further research is needed to validate their effectiveness and health economic benefits. Despite its advantages, improper use of self-monitoring devices—including wearables—may lead to excessive focus on blood pressure, frequent measurements, and fluctuations, which could negatively impact patient well-being.  \n\nIn summary, HBPM is a valuable tool for general hypertension monitoring, offering diagnostic, prognostic, and self-management benefits while requiring proper implementation to maximize its advantages.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167053, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 312, "prompt_tokens": 385, "total_tokens": 697, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 321}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
