They function by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors, thereby inhibiting sympathetic nervous system activity, reducing heart rate, and decreasing myocardial contractility, which collectively lower blood pressure. Β受体阻滞剂 are recommended as a **first-line treatment** for hypertensive patients with elevated heart rate and are also effective in managing **renal vascular hypertension**.  \n\nThese medications are categorized into subtypes, including **non-selective beta-blockers**, **highly selective β1-blockers**, and **α1/β-blockers**, each with specific clinical applications. They are particularly beneficial for patients with comorbid conditions such as **coronary artery disease (CAD)**, **chronic heart failure (HFrEF)**, and **aortic dissection**, where they improve prognosis, reduce hospitalization rates, and lower mortality. Additionally, β受体阻滞剂 are used as **adjunctive therapy for tachycardia** in preoperative preparation for pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL) and are considered safe for hypertensive patients with **lower extremity arterial stenosis**.  \n\nBeyond cardiovascular uses, β受体阻滞剂 are prescribed for **hyperthyroidism-related hypertension** due to their ability to counteract excessive adrenergic stimulation. However, they may cause side effects such as **fatigue** and **cold extremities** and can **mask hypoglycemia symptoms** in diabetic patients, requiring cautious use.  \n\nΒ受体阻滞剂 can be combined with other antihypertensive agents, such as **ARNI (angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors)**, for enhanced therapeutic effects. Overall, they remain a cornerstone in hypertension and cardiovascular disease management, with both traditional and evolving clinical applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559463, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 352, "prompt_tokens": 446, "total_tokens": 798, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 382}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
