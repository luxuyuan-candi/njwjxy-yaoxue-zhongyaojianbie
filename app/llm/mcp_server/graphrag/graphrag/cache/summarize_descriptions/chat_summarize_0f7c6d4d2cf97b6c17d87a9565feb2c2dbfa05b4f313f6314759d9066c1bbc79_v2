It serves both culinary and medicinal purposes, including being incorporated into cakes and other preparations as a health-promoting component. Medicinally, ginseng is a key herb in several classical TCM formulas, such as **大建中汤 (Dà Jiàn Zhōng Tāng)** and **附子理中汤 (Fù Zǐ Lǐ Zhōng Tāng)**, where it contributes to tonifying effects, particularly for strengthening the middle burner (digestive system) and restoring vital energy (Qi).  \n\nRenowned for its adaptogenic and restorative qualities, ginseng is often employed to enhance vitality, improve resistance to stress, and support overall well-being. Its dual role—as both a functional food ingredient and a potent medicinal herb—highlights its versatility in traditional practices. Whether consumed in culinary preparations or as part of complex herbal formulations, ginseng remains a cornerstone of TCM for its nourishing and invigorating properties.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167329, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 217, "prompt_tokens": 176, "total_tokens": 393, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 48}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
