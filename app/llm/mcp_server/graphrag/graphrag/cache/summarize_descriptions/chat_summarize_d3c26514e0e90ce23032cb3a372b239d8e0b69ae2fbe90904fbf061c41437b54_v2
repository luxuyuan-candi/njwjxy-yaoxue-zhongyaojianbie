It serves as a platform for disseminating cutting-edge studies and clinical findings aimed at advancing the understanding and treatment of stroke. Among its notable contributions, the journal has published a consensus on early supported discharge for stroke patients, highlighting evidence-based practices to improve post-stroke rehabilitation and recovery. Additionally, **STROKE** has featured research on innovative therapeutic approaches, such as the use of surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to the shoulder after acute stroke, exploring its potential benefits in restoring motor function and reducing disability. By covering a broad spectrum of stroke-related topics—from clinical guidelines to experimental therapies—the journal plays a key role in shaping stroke care and research.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517995, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 153, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 335, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 54}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
