Unlike a **hypertension emergency**, it does not involve acute or progressive damage to target organs (such as the heart, brain, or kidneys). However, it still requires prompt medical attention to lower blood pressure and prevent potential complications. Treatment for hypertension urgency is less immediate than for an emergency, often involving oral antihypertensive medications and close monitoring, rather than intravenous therapy or hospitalization. The key distinction lies in the absence of acute organ dysfunction, allowing for a more controlled and gradual reduction in blood pressure. Proper management aims to mitigate the risk of progression to a hypertensive emergency or long-term cardiovascular damage.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167072, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 363, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 73}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
