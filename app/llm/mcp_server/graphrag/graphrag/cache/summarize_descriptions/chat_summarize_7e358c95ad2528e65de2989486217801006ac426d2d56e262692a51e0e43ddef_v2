The study aimed to evaluate the effects of felodipine, a calcium channel blocker, on cardiovascular outcomes in this population. As a placebo-controlled trial, it compared the efficacy and safety of felodipine against a placebo over an extended period, providing insights into its potential benefits in reducing hypertension-related events. The trial specifically focused on Chinese hypertensive patients, ensuring relevance to this demographic. No contradictory information was found in the provided descriptions, as both entries consistently describe the study's design and target population.
