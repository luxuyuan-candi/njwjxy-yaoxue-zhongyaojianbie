They include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). These medications are often combined with other drugs to enhance efficacy and minimize side effects.  \n\nRAS inhibitors are particularly beneficial for high-risk hypertensive patients with conditions such as left atrial enlargement, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), or reduced cardiac function, as they may help reduce the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. Additionally, they are used in managing connective tissue disease (CTD)-related hypertension and have been shown to improve endothelial function and inflammation markers.  \n\nOverall, RAS inhibitors play a critical role in cardiovascular disease management, offering therapeutic benefits beyond blood pressure control, including potential protective effects on heart structure and function.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559490, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 167, "prompt_tokens": 253, "total_tokens": 420, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 189}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
