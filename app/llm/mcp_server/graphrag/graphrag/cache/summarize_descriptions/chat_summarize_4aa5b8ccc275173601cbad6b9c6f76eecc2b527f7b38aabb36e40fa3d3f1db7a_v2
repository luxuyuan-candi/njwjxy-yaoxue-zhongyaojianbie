It is frequently linked to metabolic syndrome and is commonly comorbid with conditions such as hypertension, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and cardiovascular diseases. Diabetes significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular events and microvascular complications, including diabetic nephropathy (kidney disease) and retinopathy (retinal diseases). When present alongside hypertension or PAD, stricter blood pressure control (typically <130/80 mmHg, if tolerated) is often recommended to mitigate cardiovascular risks. The condition requires ongoing management due to its chronic nature and potential for severe, multisystem complications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559409, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 133, "prompt_tokens": 296, "total_tokens": 429, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 232}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
