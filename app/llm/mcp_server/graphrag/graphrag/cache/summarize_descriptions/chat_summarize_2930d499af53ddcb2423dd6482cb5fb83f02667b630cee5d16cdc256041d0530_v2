This condition leads to hypertension (high blood pressure) and is associated with cardiovascular risks, as well as potential complications such as low potassium levels. Primary aldosteronism is often identified as a comorbidity with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). The diagnosis involves a structured process, including screening through the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) test, followed by confirmatory tests such as the saline infusion test and captopril test. Subtyping is also performed to determine the specific cause of the excessive aldosterone production.
