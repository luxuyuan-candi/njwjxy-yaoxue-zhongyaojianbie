It is administered intravenously and requires adherence to specific dosing guidelines to ensure efficacy and safety. One of the critical risks associated with nitroprusside is the potential for **cyanide toxicity**, particularly with prolonged use, necessitating careful monitoring during treatment.  \n\nThe medication is widely recognized under the brand name **Nitropresside** and is a go-to option in acute hypertensive crises due to its fast-acting properties. Its mechanism of action involves direct vasodilation, which helps swiftly lower blood pressure. However, healthcare providers must balance its benefits against the risk of adverse effects, such as cyanide accumulation, especially in patients receiving extended infusions or those with impaired detoxification pathways.  \n\nIn summary, nitroprusside is a potent, rapid-acting antihypertensive agent reserved for critical situations, with strict dosing protocols and vigilant monitoring to mitigate potential toxicity.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167073, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 387, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 127}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
