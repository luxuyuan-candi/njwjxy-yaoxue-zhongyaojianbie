These lesions are often painful and may recur periodically, especially during periods of stress or weakened immunity. While the condition can be uncomfortable and contagious, it is generally classified as a minor oral condition due to its commonality and manageable nature. Most cases do not result in severe health complications, though they can cause discomfort and social stigma. Treatment often focuses on symptom management through antiviral medications or topical remedies to reduce outbreaks and transmission.  \n\nIn summary, oral herpes simplex is a widespread but typically mild viral infection characterized by recurrent oral lesions, classified as a minor oral condition despite its potential for discomfort and contagiousness.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167018, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 345, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 110}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
