Commonly referred to as \"bad cholesterol,\" LDL is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by plaque buildup in the arteries. This plaque accumulation can narrow and harden the arteries, leading to cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and stroke.  \n\nLDL carries cholesterol from the liver to various tissues, but elevated levels can result in excessive cholesterol deposition in arterial walls. Medical guidelines consider normal LDL levels to be ≤ 3.12 mmol/L (120 mg/dL). Higher concentrations are linked to a greater likelihood of developing cardiovascular complications. Due to its role in promoting arterial plaque formation, LDL is widely recognized as a key biomarker for assessing heart disease risk.  \n\nWhile LDL is essential for normal bodily functions, maintaining optimal levels through diet, exercise, and medication (if necessary) is crucial for reducing the risk of atherosclerosis and related health issues. Its designation as \"bad cholesterol\" underscores its harmful effects when present in excess, distinguishing it from high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is considered \"good cholesterol\" for its protective role in cardiovascular health.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167385, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 241, "prompt_tokens": 268, "total_tokens": 509, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 204}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
