It is available in both topical and oral formulations, with the topical form specifically targeting localized pain relief. When administered orally, it is typically prescribed at a dosage of 50 mg three times daily due to its very short half-life of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours. This rapid metabolism necessitates frequent dosing to maintain therapeutic effects.  \n\nAs an NSAID, ketoprofen works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin production and alleviating pain and inflammation. Its short half-life makes it particularly suitable for acute conditions rather than chronic use. The topical formulation offers a targeted approach with potentially fewer systemic side effects compared to oral administration.  \n\nIn summary, ketoprofen is a versatile NSAID with applications in both localized and systemic pain management, characterized by its short duration of action and effectiveness in treating acute inflammatory conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752166980, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 387, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 120}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
