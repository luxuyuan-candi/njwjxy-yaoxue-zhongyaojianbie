Known for its dual role as both a food and herbal remedy, it is commonly referred to as coix seed in English. In TCM, 薏苡仁 is incorporated into prescriptions, typically in doses of 12–15 grams, to leverage its therapeutic properties.  \n\nPrimarily, 薏苡仁 is recognized for its ability to **strengthen the spleen (健脾)** and **resolve dampness (化湿)**, making it particularly beneficial for dietary调理 (dietary regulation) during the long summer season. It is also classified as a **food-medicine substance (食药物质)**, suitable for managing conditions such as **hyperlipidemia (高脂血症)** of various types, including phlegm-turbidity obstruction (痰浊内阻型), phlegm-stasis intermingling (痰瘀互结型), qi deficiency with blood stasis (气虚血瘀型), and spleen deficiency with dampness excess (脾虚湿盛型).  \n\nBeyond its medicinal applications, 薏苡仁 is utilized in culinary contexts, often incorporated into recipes for its health-promoting benefits. Its multifaceted use—spanning herbal formulations, dietary supplements, and functional foods—highlights its importance in both traditional medicine and daily wellness practices.  \n\nIn summary, 薏苡仁 is a valued TCM herb and functional food, prized for its健脾化湿 effects and adaptability in treating dampness-related disorders and metabolic conditions like hyperlipidemia. Its integration into medicinal and dietary practices underscores its enduring significance in Chinese health traditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167146, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 346, "prompt_tokens": 273, "total_tokens": 619, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 209}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
