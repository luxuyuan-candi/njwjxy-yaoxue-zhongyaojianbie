As an SSRI, it works by increasing serotonin levels in the brain, but this mechanism also carries certain risks. One notable concern is its potential to accumulate as active metabolites in infants, making it advisable to avoid during breastfeeding. Additionally, FLUOXETINE poses a risk of serotonin syndrome—a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by excessive serotonin activity—when combined with other serotonergic drugs such as linezolid. This interaction occurs due to synergistic effects on serotonin metabolism, underscoring the importance of careful medication management when prescribing FLUOXETINE.  \n\nIn summary, while FLUOXETINE is an effective antidepressant, its use requires caution, particularly in breastfeeding individuals and when co-administered with other drugs that affect serotonin levels.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167547, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 177, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 359, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 118}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
