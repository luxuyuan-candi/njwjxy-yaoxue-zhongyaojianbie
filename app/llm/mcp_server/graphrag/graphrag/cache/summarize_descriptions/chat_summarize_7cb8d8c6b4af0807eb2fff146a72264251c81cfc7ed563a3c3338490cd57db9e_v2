It is a key component of cell membranes, providing structural integrity, and serves as a raw material for the synthesis of steroid hormones (such as cortisol, estrogen, and testosterone) and bile acids, which aid in digestion. While cholesterol is essential for normal bodily functions, excessive levels—particularly of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol—can contribute to cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and heart disease.  \n\nDietary cholesterol is found exclusively in animal-based foods, with varying concentrations depending on the source. Foods high in cholesterol include egg yolks, organ meats (such as animal brains and liver), fatty cuts of meat, fish roe (eggs), and high-fat dairy products like cream. Due to its association with increased cardiovascular risk, health guidelines often recommend limiting cholesterol intake, particularly in low-fat or heart-healthy diets. However, recent research suggests that dietary cholesterol has a less significant impact on blood cholesterol levels for most people compared to saturated and trans fats.  \n\nIn summary, cholesterol is a crucial biological molecule with structural and metabolic functions, but its levels must be carefully regulated to maintain health. A balanced diet and lifestyle are important for managing cholesterol and reducing the risk of related diseases.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517948, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 258, "prompt_tokens": 254, "total_tokens": 512, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 190}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
