The journal has featured studies on diverse therapeutic interventions, including the use of continuous passive motion to improve shoulder joint integrity in stroke patients, as well as investigations into the impact of speech and language therapy intensity on early recovery from poststroke aphasia. These studies highlight the journal's commitment to advancing evidence-based rehabilitation practices, covering both physical and cognitive aspects of recovery. By disseminating such research, **CLIN REHABIL** contributes to the broader understanding of effective rehabilitation strategies, supporting clinicians and researchers in optimizing patient outcomes. The journal serves as a key resource for professionals in the field, offering insights into innovative and multidisciplinary approaches to post-stroke care.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167582, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 163, "prompt_tokens": 192, "total_tokens": 355, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 128}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
