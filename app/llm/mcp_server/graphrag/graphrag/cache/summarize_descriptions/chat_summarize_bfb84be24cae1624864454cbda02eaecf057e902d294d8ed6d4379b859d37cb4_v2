LDL is considered harmful because it contributes to the buildup of fatty plaques in the arteries (atherosclerosis), increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes. Both descriptions emphasize LDL's role in arterial plaque formation, reinforcing its classification as a detrimental form of cholesterol when present in excessive amounts.  \n\nThe consistency across the descriptions confirms that LDL is a subtype of cholesterol with a well-established association with adverse health effects.
