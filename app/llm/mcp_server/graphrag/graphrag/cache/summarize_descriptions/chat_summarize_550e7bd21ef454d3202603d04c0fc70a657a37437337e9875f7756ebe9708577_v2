Elevated levels of lipids, such as cholesterol and triglycerides, in the blood—a hallmark of hyperlipidemia—contribute to the buildup of plaques in arteries, leading to conditions like atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and stroke. This relationship underscores hyperlipidemia's role as a major contributor to the global rise in cardiovascular diseases, which remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
