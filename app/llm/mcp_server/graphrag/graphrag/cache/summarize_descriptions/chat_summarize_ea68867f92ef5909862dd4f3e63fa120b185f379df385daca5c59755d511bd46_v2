It is specifically formulated to address colds or flu-like illnesses accompanied by **sweating and deficiency of the body's surface (biao xu)**, which differentiates it from other cold remedies targeting wind-cold excess syndromes.  \n\nThe medication is designed to relieve symptoms by reinforcing the body's exterior while dispelling pathogenic wind-cold. Its dual action makes it suitable for patients who experience **colds with pronounced sweating**, as it helps stabilize the body's defensive qi (wei qi) and alleviates discomfort. By harmonizing these effects, 表虚感冒颗粒 provides a targeted approach to managing colds in individuals with underlying deficiency patterns.  \n\nIn summary, 表虚感冒颗粒 is a specialized Chinese herbal formula for **wind-cold deficiency syndrome with excessive sweating**, offering both symptom relief and support for the body's weakened exterior defenses. Its use is distinct from general cold medicines, as it addresses the unique combination of external pathogens and internal deficiency.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167590, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 252, "prompt_tokens": 166, "total_tokens": 418, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 102}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
