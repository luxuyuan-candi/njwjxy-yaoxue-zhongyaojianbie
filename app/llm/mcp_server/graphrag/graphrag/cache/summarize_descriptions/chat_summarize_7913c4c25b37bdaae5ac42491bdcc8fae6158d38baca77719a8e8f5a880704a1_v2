Often referred to as \"good cholesterol,\" HDL-C plays a protective role by aiding in the removal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from the bloodstream, thereby reducing the accumulation of harmful plaque in arteries. Low levels of HDL-C are considered a significant risk factor for ASCVD, with concentrations below **1.0 mmol/L** indicating an increased likelihood of dyslipidemia and associated cardiovascular complications.  \n\nHDL-C is routinely evaluated in clinical settings as part of lipid profiling for diagnosing dyslipidemia and guiding preventive care strategies. While lifestyle modifications such as exercise and dietary changes can positively influence HDL-C levels, pharmacological interventions like **statin drugs** have also been shown to increase HDL-C concentrations, further supporting cardiovascular health.  \n\nIn summary, HDL-C serves as a critical biomarker for cardiovascular risk assessment, with higher levels generally associated with reduced ASCVD risk due to its role in cholesterol transport and arterial protection. Monitoring and managing HDL-C levels, alongside other lipid parameters, remains an essential component of preventive cardiology.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517913, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 236, "prompt_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 501, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 137}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
