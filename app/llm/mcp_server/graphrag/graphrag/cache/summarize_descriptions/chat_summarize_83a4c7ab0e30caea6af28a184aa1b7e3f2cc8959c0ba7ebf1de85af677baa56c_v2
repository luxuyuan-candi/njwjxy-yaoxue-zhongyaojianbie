It is commonly used in both home massage therapy and clinical acupuncture for its therapeutic benefits. As the lower he-sea point of the stomach meridian (胃的下合穴), it is particularly effective in treating abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal disorders.  \n\nIn clinical practice, 足三里 is frequently stimulated through acupuncture to alleviate abdominal discomfort and improve digestive function. Additionally, it is recommended for self-care practices, such as acupressure, as part of home-based therapies like FDr (Functional Diarrhea Relief) treatment.  \n\nThe point’s dual application—both in professional acupuncture and self-administered massage—highlights its versatility in TCM. While descriptions may vary slightly in emphasis (clinical vs. home use), they consistently affirm its role in addressing abdominal pain and related conditions. Thus, 足三里 serves as a key therapeutic point in both professional and personal healthcare within traditional Chinese medicine.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167167, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 206, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 392, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 122}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
