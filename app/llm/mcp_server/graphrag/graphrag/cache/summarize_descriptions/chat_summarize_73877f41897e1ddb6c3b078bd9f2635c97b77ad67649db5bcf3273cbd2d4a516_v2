Primarily used for **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**, ARNI improves prognosis, reduces hospitalization rates, and lowers mortality in these patients. It is also effective in **hypertension management**, often used in combination with other medications for blood pressure control.  \n\nAdditionally, ARNI has shown benefits in **chronic kidney disease (CKD)** by reducing proteinuria and slowing kidney function decline. Some formulations, such as **sacubitril/valsartan (沙库巴曲缬沙坦)**, are specifically approved for **hypertension and heart failure treatment**, though clinicians must consider potential drug interactions.  \n\nARNI may also **improve hyperuricemia** (high uric acid levels). However, due to its vasodilatory effects, it can contribute to **intraoperative hypotension**, and guidelines recommend pausing ARNI **24 hours before surgery** to mitigate this risk.  \n\nRecognized in the **2018 Chinese Hypertension Guidelines**, ARNI represents a newer therapeutic approach for cardiovascular and renal conditions, offering combined **renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition** and neprilysin blockade. Its dual mechanism makes it valuable in managing **post-myocardial infarction** cases and other cardiovascular diseases.  \n\nIn summary, ARNI is a versatile drug class with applications in **heart failure, hypertension, CKD, and hyperuricemia**, though perioperative caution is advised.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559464, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 332, "prompt_tokens": 521, "total_tokens": 853, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 457}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
