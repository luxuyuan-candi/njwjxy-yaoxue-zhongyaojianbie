It has contributed to advancing clinical practices by disseminating key findings and expert recommendations. Notably, the journal has published a **consensus on early supported discharge (ESD) for stroke patients**, providing evidence-based guidelines to optimize recovery outcomes by transitioning patients from hospital to home-based care when appropriate. Additionally, **STROKE** has featured research on innovative rehabilitation techniques, such as **surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) applied to the shoulder after acute stroke**, exploring its potential to improve motor recovery and reduce post-stroke complications. Together, these publications highlight the journal's role in addressing both systemic care approaches and targeted therapeutic interventions for stroke patients.  \n\nThe journal serves as a valuable resource for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers, bridging gaps between emerging evidence and practical applications in stroke management. By covering diverse topics—from care protocols like ESD to novel therapies like NMES—**STROKE** fosters a comprehensive understanding of stroke rehabilitation and recovery.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167586, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 215, "prompt_tokens": 171, "total_tokens": 386, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 43}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
