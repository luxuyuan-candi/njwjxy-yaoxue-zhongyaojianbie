It is effective in managing severe hypertriglyceridemia, often in combination with other treatments such as fibrates or ω-3 fatty acids. However, nicotinic acid has notable limitations, particularly in patients with diabetes, as it can worsen glucose tolerance and is therefore not recommended for diabetic individuals.  \n\nIn summary, nicotinic acid serves as a therapeutic option for lipid regulation, particularly in cases of severe hypertriglyceridemia, but its use requires careful consideration of metabolic effects, especially in diabetic patients. The drug’s benefits in lipid management must be weighed against its potential adverse impact on glucose metabolism.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167458, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 212, "total_tokens": 362, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 148}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
