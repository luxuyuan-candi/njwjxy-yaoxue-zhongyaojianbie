It is available in both oral and intravenous formulations, with the intravenous form specifically employed for acute management of these cardiovascular conditions. As a calcium channel blocker, Diltiazem works by inhibiting calcium ion influx into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac cells, leading to vasodilation and reduced myocardial workload.
