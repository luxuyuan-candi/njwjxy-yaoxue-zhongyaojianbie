As a global health authority, WHO plays a pivotal role in providing evidence-based guidelines, health statistics, and recommendations to address major health challenges worldwide.  \n\nWHO has emphasized the importance of physical activity, stating in 1995 that walking is the best form of exercise for humans due to its alignment with our physiological and anatomical structure. Additionally, the organization offers detailed health check-up guidelines, including recommendations for lipid testing: every two years for individuals with no underlying risk factors and annually for those over 40, obese individuals, or people with specific risk factors or existing cardiovascular conditions.  \n\nWHO also monitors and reports on global health trends, particularly concerning cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The organization provides comprehensive statistics on CVD-related mortality rates and analyzes emerging trends in different types of cardiovascular conditions. Through its research and public health initiatives, WHO aims to reduce the global burden of non-communicable diseases, including CVDs, by promoting preventive measures and evidence-based interventions.  \n\nIn summary, the World Health Organization serves as a leading global health authority, offering guidance on exercise, preventive health measures, and disease surveillance while addressing critical public health issues such as cardiovascular diseases.
