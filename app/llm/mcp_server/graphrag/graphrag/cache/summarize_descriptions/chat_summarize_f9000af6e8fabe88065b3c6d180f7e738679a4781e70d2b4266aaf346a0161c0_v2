They function by increasing serotonin levels in the brain, which helps regulate mood. SSRIs are also frequently used during pregnancy, though with some considerations. While most SSRIs are considered relatively safe for use in pregnancy, paroxetine is an exception due to its association with an increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. However, SSRIs, including paroxetine, are not generally linked to fetal heart disease or death.  \n\nOverall, SSRIs remain a first-line treatment for depression and other mood disorders, balancing efficacy with a well-documented safety profile, though individual medications within the class may have specific risks that require careful evaluation, particularly in pregnant patients. The decision to use SSRIs during pregnancy should involve a thorough risk-benefit assessment by healthcare providers.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517992, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 202, "prompt_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 416, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 150}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
