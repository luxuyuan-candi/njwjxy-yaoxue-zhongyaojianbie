It is a well-documented medical condition, with discussions in medical journals covering its various severity levels and corresponding treatment recommendations.  \n\nThe condition arises when the immune system overreacts to airborne allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, or pet dander, leading to inflammation of the nasal passages. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, with some individuals experiencing significant discomfort and impaired quality of life. Medical literature provides tailored treatment approaches based on symptom severity, which may include antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids, or immunotherapy for long-term management.  \n\nIn summary, 变应性鼻炎 (allergic rhinitis) is an allergen-induced nasal condition marked by sneezing, nasal congestion, and rhinorrhea, with treatment strategies varying depending on the severity of the symptoms.
