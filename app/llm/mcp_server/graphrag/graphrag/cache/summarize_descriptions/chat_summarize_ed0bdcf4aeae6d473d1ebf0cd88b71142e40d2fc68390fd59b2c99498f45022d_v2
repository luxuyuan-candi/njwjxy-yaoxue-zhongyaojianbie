As a medicinal ingredient, it is incorporated into various formulations, such as **桑菊饮** (Sang Ju Yin) and **菊花决明子粥** (Chrysanthemum and Cassia Seed Porridge), the latter of which is specifically employed to address hyperlipidemia and hypertension.  \n\nIn TCM, 菊花 is recognized for its dual role in nourishing liver and kidney yin fluids (**滋养肝肾阴津**) and regulating liver qi (**疏肝理气**), making it beneficial for liver health and seasonal dietary adjustments, particularly in spring. It is classified as a **食药物质** (food-medicine substance) and is particularly effective for individuals with **痰浊内阻型** (phlegm-dampness obstruction) or **肝肾阴虚型** (liver-kidney yin deficiency) hyperlipidemia.  \n\nResearch and traditional use highlight its cardiovascular benefits, including **lipid-lowering effects** and a **mild yet consistent antihypertensive action**. Elderly individuals often blend small amounts of 菊花 with green tea to support cardiovascular health. Additionally, it is commonly brewed as a tea for its medicinal properties and soothing effects.  \n\nIn summary, 菊花 serves as a multifunctional herb in both therapeutic and dietary contexts, valued for its ability to address metabolic disorders, support liver and kidney function, and promote cardiovascular wellness.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167262, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 306, "prompt_tokens": 282, "total_tokens": 588, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 218}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
