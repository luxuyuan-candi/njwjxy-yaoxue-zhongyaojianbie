It is primarily employed to strengthen the spleen and replenish qi, making it a key ingredient in formulations such as **补中益气汤 (Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang)**, a classic TCM remedy designed to boost energy and improve digestive function.  \n\nKnown for its mild yet effective nature, 党参 serves as a gentler alternative to stronger qi-tonifying herbs like ginseng. It is widely utilized in clinical practice to address fatigue, poor appetite, and general weakness resulting from spleen and qi deficiencies. Its dual role in both nourishing qi and supporting spleen health underscores its importance in TCM therapeutics.  \n\nOverall, 党参 is a versatile and widely respected herb in Chinese medicine, valued for its ability to enhance vitality and promote overall well-being.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167478, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 180, "prompt_tokens": 172, "total_tokens": 352, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 44}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
