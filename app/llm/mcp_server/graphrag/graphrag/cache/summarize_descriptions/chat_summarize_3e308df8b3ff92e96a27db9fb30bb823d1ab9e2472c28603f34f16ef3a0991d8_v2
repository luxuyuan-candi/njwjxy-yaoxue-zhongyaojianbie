Elevated Lp(a) levels are recognized as an independent genetic risk factor for ASCVD, contributing to the development and progression of atherosclerotic conditions. Additionally, Lp(a) levels are clinically utilized as a biomarker to assess an individual's risk of ASCVD, helping to identify those who may benefit from early intervention or more aggressive management strategies.
