It is known to influence the anticoagulant activity of warfarin, as alterations in its enzymatic activity—whether through inhibition or other mechanisms—can directly impact the drug's efficacy. The enzyme has been studied in both English and Chinese scientific literature, with the latter emphasizing its critical role in warfarin metabolism. Inhibitors of CYP2C9 are documented, and their effects on the enzyme's function are an important consideration in pharmacokinetics and drug interactions. The combined descriptions highlight CYP2C9's central role in metabolizing certain drugs, particularly warfarin, and underscore the clinical implications of its inhibition.  \n\n(Word count: 118)", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517985, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 163, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 353, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 62}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
