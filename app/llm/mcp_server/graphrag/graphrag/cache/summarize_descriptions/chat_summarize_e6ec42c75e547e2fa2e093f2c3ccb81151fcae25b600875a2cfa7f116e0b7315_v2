The condition is closely linked to the rising prevalence of heart failure, as sustained high blood pressure strains the cardiovascular system over time. Research indicates that reducing blood pressure can significantly lower the risk of heart failure—by as much as 49%—particularly in patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease. This underscores the critical role of hypertension management in preventing heart failure, especially in high-risk populations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559751, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 106, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 303, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 133}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
