PCSK9 inhibitors are a class of medications designed to significantly reduce LDL-C levels in patients with high cholesterol, particularly when LDL-C remains elevated despite treatment with statins and ezetimibe. These inhibitors serve as an effective therapeutic option for individuals who do not achieve adequate LDL-C reduction through conventional lipid-lowering therapies.  \n\nIn summary, PCSK9 inhibitors play a critical role in lowering LDL-C, especially in cases where other treatments, such as statins and ezetimibe, prove insufficient.
