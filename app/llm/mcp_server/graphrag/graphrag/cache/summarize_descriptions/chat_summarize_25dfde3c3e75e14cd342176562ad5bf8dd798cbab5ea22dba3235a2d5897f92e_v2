It is administered both orally and intravenously as an antihypertensive drug, including during pregnancy, though it may carry potential side effects such as fetal bradycardia and skin itching. Additionally, labetalol is employed in managing blood pressure in acute ischemic stroke patients prior to treatment. Its dual mechanism of action, combining alpha and beta blockade, makes it effective for rapid blood pressure control in critical conditions. Overall, labetalol serves as a versatile therapeutic agent for hypertension across different patient populations and medical scenarios.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559500, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 338, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 139}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
