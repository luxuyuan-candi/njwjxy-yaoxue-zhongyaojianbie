They function by increasing serotonin levels in the brain, which helps alleviate symptoms of depression and other mood disorders.  \n\nSSRIs are frequently considered for use during pregnancy, though certain precautions apply. While most SSRIs are generally not associated with fetal heart disease or death, paroxetine is an exception, as it may increase the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. As a result, healthcare providers often avoid prescribing paroxetine to pregnant patients, opting for alternative SSRIs when necessary.  \n\nOverall, SSRIs remain a cornerstone in depression treatment due to their efficacy and relatively favorable safety profile, though individual patient factors—such as pregnancy—require careful consideration when selecting the appropriate medication.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167566, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 189, "prompt_tokens": 258, "total_tokens": 447, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 194}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
