ARNIs, on the other hand, are a newer class of drugs that combine **an ARB component** (similar to traditional ARBs) with a **neprilysin inhibitor**, which enhances natriuretic peptides to further improve cardiovascular outcomes. Due to their shared ARB mechanism, both ARBs and ARNIs can contribute to **intraoperative hypotension** and are generally recommended to be **discontinued before surgery** to minimize risks.  \n\nAdditionally, both ARBs and ARNIs have been found to **improve hyperuricemia**, offering potential benefits beyond blood pressure control. While ARBs function solely through angiotensin receptor blockade, ARNIs provide a dual approach by also inhibiting neprilysin, making them particularly effective for **hypertension management** and certain cardiovascular conditions.  \n\nIn summary, ARNIs are an evolution of ARBs, incorporating their antihypertensive effects while adding neprilysin inhibition for broader therapeutic action. Both classes share similarities in their mechanisms and side effects but differ in their overall pharmacological profiles.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559759, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 268, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 491, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 159}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
