It is often administered alongside 20% mannitol for enhanced therapeutic effect. The solution aids in reducing intracranial pressure by drawing fluid out of the brain tissue and into the bloodstream, thereby alleviating swelling. Additionally, glycerol fructose plays a role in maintaining electrolyte balance, though its use necessitates careful monitoring of renal function to ensure patient safety.  \n\nThis agent is particularly valued in clinical settings for its effectiveness in treating conditions associated with elevated intracranial pressure, such as traumatic brain injuries or stroke. Its hypertonic properties make it a reliable option for osmotic therapy, though healthcare providers must balance its benefits with potential risks, including renal complications. Overall, glycerol fructose serves as a critical tool in neurocritical care, combining therapeutic efficacy with the need for vigilant patient monitoring.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167206, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 180, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 376, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 132}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
