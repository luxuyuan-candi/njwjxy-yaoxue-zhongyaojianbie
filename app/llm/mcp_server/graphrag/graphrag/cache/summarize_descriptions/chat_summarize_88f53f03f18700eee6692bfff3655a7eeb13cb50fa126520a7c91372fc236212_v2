These ingredients are often combined in traditional Chinese medicinal cakes, which are designed to promote health and balance in accordance with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) principles.  \n\n茯苓, derived from a fungus, is valued for its diuretic and calming properties, often used to support digestion and reduce dampness in the body. 莲子, the edible seeds of the lotus plant, are known for their nourishing effects on the spleen, heart, and kidneys, as well as their ability to promote relaxation and improve sleep.  \n\nAs medicinal foods, both ingredients are recognized for their dual role in culinary and therapeutic applications. Their inclusion in the same dish, such as a traditional medicinal cake, highlights their complementary functions in TCM, where they may be used to enhance overall wellness, support digestion, and harmonize bodily functions. Their shared classification as traditional Chinese medicinal foods underscores their longstanding use in both dietary and healing practices.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167679, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 209, "prompt_tokens": 161, "total_tokens": 370, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 97}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
