They are widely recommended as initial treatments for hypertension, particularly in specific patient populations such as those with obesity, diabetes, or lower extremity arterial disease. Both are also considered first-line antihypertensives for diabetic patients and are often used interchangeably in clinical practice.  \n\nACEI and ARB are also recommended for patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and are used to manage hypertension in children, though they must be avoided during pregnancy due to potential risks. While both drugs function similarly by inhibiting the angiotensin system, ARBs are frequently prescribed as an alternative to ACEIs for patients who experience intolerable side effects, such as dry cough, associated with ACEIs.  \n\nAdditionally, both drug classes are utilized in hypertension subemergency cases and serve as foundational agents in combined antihypertensive therapy, especially for patients with comorbid conditions like diabetes and hypertension. Despite their similarities, the choice between ACEI and ARB may depend on patient-specific factors, including tolerability and underlying health conditions. Overall, they remain cornerstone therapies in hypertension management due to their efficacy and broad applicability.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559759, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 269, "prompt_tokens": 422, "total_tokens": 691, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 358}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
