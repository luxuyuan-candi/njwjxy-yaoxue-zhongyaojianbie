By inhibiting CYP3A4, posaconazole slows the metabolism of certain drugs that are substrates of this enzyme. This interaction can lead to increased plasma concentrations of the affected drugs, potentially raising the risk of adverse effects or toxicity. The combined descriptions emphasize posaconazole's significant inhibitory effect on CYP3A4-mediated drug metabolism, highlighting its clinical relevance in drug-drug interactions.  \n\n(Word count: 78)", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167792, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 115, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 295, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 116}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
