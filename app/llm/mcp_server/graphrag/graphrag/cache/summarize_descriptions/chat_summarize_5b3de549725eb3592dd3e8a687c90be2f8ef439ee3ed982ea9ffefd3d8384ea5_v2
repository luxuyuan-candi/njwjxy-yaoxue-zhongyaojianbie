This model involves a 15-month intervention period aimed at improving lipid profiles and overall cardiovascular health in patients with dyslipidemia.  \n\nBy combining health education—which likely covers dietary guidance, lifestyle modifications, and disease awareness—with traditional physical exercises, the **健康加油站模式** provides a holistic approach to dyslipidemia management. The program is tailored for community settings, emphasizing accessibility and long-term adherence to healthy practices.  \n\nBoth descriptions align in identifying the model’s focus on dyslipidemia management, its community-oriented framework, and the integration of educational and physical activity components.
