ARNI combines neprilysin inhibition with RAS blockade, which includes mechanisms similar to ACEIs or ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers). It serves as an alternative to ACEIs in the treatment of HFrEF. However, due to potential interactions, ARNI and ACEI should not be used concomitantly; a transition period of at least 36 hours is required when switching between the two therapies to avoid adverse effects.  \n\nIn summary, while both ARNI and ACEI are effective for HFrEF, they have distinct mechanisms of action and should not be co-administered. ARNI offers an alternative with additional neprilysin inhibition, but proper washout periods must be observed when transitioning from ACEI to ARNI.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559765, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 202, "total_tokens": 396, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 138}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
