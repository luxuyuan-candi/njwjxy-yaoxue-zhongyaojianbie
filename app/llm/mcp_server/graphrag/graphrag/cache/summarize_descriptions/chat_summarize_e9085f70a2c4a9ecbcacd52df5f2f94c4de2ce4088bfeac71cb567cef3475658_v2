It is often associated with metabolic syndrome and can be exacerbated by underlying conditions such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes. CKD is a significant factor in cardiovascular risk stratification, as it increases the likelihood of cardiovascular complications, particularly in hypertensive patients. Treatment options include mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), with finerenone specifically approved for managing CKD in patients with type 2 diabetes.
