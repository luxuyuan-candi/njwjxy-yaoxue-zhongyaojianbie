It is marketed under brand names such as **Zocor** and **舒降之**. As a **lipophilic statin**, simvastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol production in the liver. It is metabolized by the **CYP3A4** enzyme, which plays a key role in its pharmacokinetics and potential drug interactions.  \n\nSimvastatin helps lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, contributing to improved cardiovascular health. Its lipophilic nature allows it to penetrate cell membranes effectively, enhancing its therapeutic action. However, due to its metabolism via CYP3A4, caution is advised when co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., certain antibiotics, antifungals, or grapefruit juice), as this may increase the risk of adverse effects such as myopathy or liver toxicity.  \n\nIn summary, simvastatin is a widely used statin for managing dyslipidemia, available under multiple brand names, with its efficacy and safety influenced by its lipophilic properties and CYP3A4-dependent metabolism.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167405, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 248, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 432, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 120}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
