TCAs are known for their significant anticholinergic effects, which can cause dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and urinary retention, as well as their potential for cardiac toxicity, including arrhythmias and hypotension. These risks make them generally unsuitable for elderly patients, who are more vulnerable to such adverse effects.  \n\nDespite their drawbacks, TCAs remain an important option in certain cases, particularly when other treatments have failed. They work by inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine, though their mechanism is less selective than that of newer antidepressants such as SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors). While their use has declined in favor of safer alternatives, TCAs continue to be relevant in specific clinical scenarios, underscoring their enduring role in psychiatric treatment.  \n\nThe descriptions consistently highlight TCAs as a well-established but secondary option in modern antidepressant therapy, emphasizing their efficacy alongside their notable side effects and risks.
