It is a potent inhibitor of several cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP3A4/5, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6, which play a significant role in drug metabolism.  \n\nOne notable interaction involves grapefruit juice, which inhibits the metabolism of amiodarone, particularly its metabolite N-desethylamiodarone (N-DEA). This inhibition leads to increased systemic exposure, as reflected by higher AUC (area under the curve) and Cmax (peak concentration) values. Consequently, grapefruit juice consumption may enhance the drug's effects and potential side effects.  \n\nAdditionally, amiodarone interacts with other medications, such as warfarin. When co-administered, it increases the risk of bleeding due to its inhibitory effects on warfarin metabolism.  \n\nIn summary, amiodarone is a clinically important antiarrhythmic drug with significant metabolic interactions, particularly with grapefruit juice and warfarin. Patients taking amiodarone should be advised to avoid grapefruit juice and closely monitor for adverse effects when combined with other medications metabolized by CYP enzymes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167538, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 249, "prompt_tokens": 261, "total_tokens": 510, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 133}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
