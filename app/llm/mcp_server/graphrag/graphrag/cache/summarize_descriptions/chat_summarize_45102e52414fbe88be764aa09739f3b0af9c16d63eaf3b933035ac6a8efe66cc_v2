They are widely used to treat **hypertension (high blood pressure)**, **heart failure (particularly HFrEF, where they improve prognosis and reduce hospitalization and mortality rates)**, and **diabetic nephropathy**, while also providing **organ protection in diabetic patients**.  \n\nARBs are recommended as **first-line therapy** for various patient groups, including those with **peripheral arterial disease (PAD)**, **lower extremity arterial disease**, **obesity**, **chronic kidney disease (CKD) with proteinuria**, and **autoimmune conditions** where ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) are not tolerated. They are also suggested as an **alternative to ACEIs** for patients experiencing side effects like **dry cough**.  \n\nAdditionally, ARBs may offer **benefits beyond blood pressure control**, such as **reducing the risk of mood disorders**, **improving hyperuricemia**, and serving as a **base for combined antihypertensive therapy in diabetic patients with hypertension**. However, they **should not be combined with ACEIs or direct renin inhibitors** due to potential adverse effects like **hyperkalemia and kidney events**.  \n\nPrecautions include **discontinuing ARBs before surgery** to avoid **hypotension (low blood pressure)** and **avoiding use in pregnancy** due to potential risks. Common ARBs include **losartan**, which is also used in pediatric hypertension management.  \n\nIn summary, ARBs are a versatile class of **RAS inhibitors** with broad applications in **cardiovascular and renal protection**, particularly in high-risk populations such as those with **diabetes, obesity, or heart failure**.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559462, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 366, "prompt_tokens": 828, "total_tokens": 1194, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 764}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
