First extracted from gallstones in the 18th century, cholesterol has since been recognized for its diverse functions in human health. It is classified into two main types: low-density lipoprotein (LDL), often referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol due to its association with cardiovascular risks, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), known as \"good\" cholesterol for its protective effects.  \n\nCholesterol is essential for maintaining body structure, supporting life activities, and even contributing to cancer prevention, though the mechanisms behind this protective role are not fully detailed. While it is a necessary substance, excessive cholesterol intake can be harmful, particularly when LDL levels are elevated. Dietary guidelines recommend limiting cholesterol consumption to no more than 300 mg per day to mitigate health risks such as heart disease.  \n\nDespite its importance, cholesterol is often highlighted as a nutrient to monitor and restrict in diets to maintain optimal health. Balancing its intake is crucial, as it underscores the dual nature of cholesterolâ€”both indispensable in moderation and potentially detrimental in excess.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167371, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 236, "prompt_tokens": 291, "total_tokens": 527, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 163}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
