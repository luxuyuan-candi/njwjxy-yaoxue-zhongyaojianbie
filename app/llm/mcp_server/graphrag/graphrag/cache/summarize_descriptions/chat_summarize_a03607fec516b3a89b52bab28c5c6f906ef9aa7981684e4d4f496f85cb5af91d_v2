Specifically, it has been identified as a key participant in the metabolism of dapagliflozin (达格列净), a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. The enzyme is part of the uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) family, which facilitates the glucuronidation process—a critical phase in the detoxification and elimination of drugs and other xenobiotics.  \n\nUGT1A9 is recognized for its broad substrate specificity, contributing to the metabolism of numerous therapeutic agents beyond dapagliflozin. Its activity can influence drug efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics, making it an important consideration in pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine. The enzyme's role in metabolizing dapagliflozin underscores its relevance in diabetes treatment, as variations in UGT1A9 activity may affect individual responses to the drug.  \n\nIn summary, UGT1A9 is a metabolizing enzyme with a demonstrated role in drug processing, including the metabolism of dapagliflozin, highlighting its importance in both general pharmacology and specific therapeutic contexts.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167518, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 247, "prompt_tokens": 173, "total_tokens": 420, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 109}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
