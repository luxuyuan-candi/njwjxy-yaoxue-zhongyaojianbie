Elevated levels of LDL contribute significantly to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of fatty deposits, or plaques, within arterial walls. As LDL cholesterol accumulates in the arteries, it promotes inflammation and plaque formation, narrowing the blood vessels and increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes.  \n\nThe relationship between LDL and atherosclerosis is well-established, with LDL being a key driver of cholesterol deposition in arterial tissues. Managing LDL levels through lifestyle changes, medications, or other interventions is critical in reducing the progression of atherosclerosis and its associated complications.  \n\nThis summary integrates both descriptions, confirming that high LDL levels are a major factor in atherosclerosis development due to LDL's role in cholesterol transport and arterial deposition.
