As a strong inhibitor, it significantly slows the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4, potentially leading to increased plasma concentrations and prolonged effects of these medications. This interaction is clinically important, as it may elevate the risk of adverse effects or toxicity when clarithromycin is co-administered with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. The inhibitory effect is consistent across descriptions, with no contradictory information. Both English and Chinese sources confirm that clarithromycin acts as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, underscoring its role in drug-drug interactions.  \n\nIn summary, clarithromycin (克拉霉素) exerts a strong inhibitory effect on CYP3A4, altering the pharmacokinetics of co-administered drugs metabolized by this enzyme. This property necessitates careful consideration in clinical practice to avoid potential therapeutic complications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167793, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 205, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 398, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 129}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
