Studies indicate that smokers typically exhibit serum cholesterol levels **10%-15% higher** than non-smokers, highlighting the impact of smoking on lipid metabolism. Additionally, serum cholesterol levels are affected by **diet, exercise, and genetic predisposition**, which collectively play a significant role in determining an individual's lipid profile. These findings underscore the importance of both behavioral and biological factors in managing cholesterol levels.  \n\nThe combined evidence suggests that while smoking elevates serum cholesterol, other modifiable factors like diet and physical activity, as well as non-modifiable genetic influences, also contribute to its regulation. This comprehensive view emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to cholesterol management, addressing both lifestyle choices and underlying genetic factors.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167396, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 164, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 343, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 115}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
