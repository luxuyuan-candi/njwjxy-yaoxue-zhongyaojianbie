Among them, a subgroup consists of obese individuals who require specialized medical supervision during exercise due to heightened cardiovascular risks and potential complications. This underscores the importance of tailored exercise regimens to ensure safety and efficacy.  \n\nAdditionally, not all CHD patients are suitable candidates for cholesterol-lowering treatments, as individual factors such as comorbidities, medication tolerance, and disease severity influence treatment decisions. This highlights the necessity of personalized medical assessments to determine the most appropriate therapeutic approaches for each patient.  \n\nIn summary, coronary heart disease patients encompass a spectrum of clinical profiles, including those with obesity requiring monitored physical activity and others for whom cholesterol-lowering therapies may not be advisable. Comprehensive care for CHD patients must account for these variations to optimize outcomes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167446, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 175, "prompt_tokens": 175, "total_tokens": 350, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 47}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
