It plays a key role in maintaining cardiovascular and renal homeostasis. RAS is often overactive in kidney diseases such as Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) and can also be activated in conditions like white coat hypertension. The system, sometimes referred to simply as the renin-angiotensin system, functions through a cascade of hormonal and enzymatic interactions to modulate blood pressure and fluid balance. Overall, RAS is a central regulator in both normal physiology and pathological states related to hypertension and kidney dysfunction.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559494, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 323, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 131}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
