It is defined as hypertension without identifiable secondary causes, such as kidney disease or hormonal disorders, and is primarily driven by dysfunction in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS).  \n\nAs a prevalent form of high blood pressure, primary hypertension often develops gradually over time due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Unlike secondary hypertension, which stems from an underlying medical condition, primary hypertension is diagnosed after ruling out other potential causes. Management typically involves lifestyle modifications (e.g., diet, exercise, stress reduction) and, when necessary, antihypertensive medications to control blood pressure and reduce the risk of complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage.  \n\nThe condition underscores the importance of ongoing monitoring and adherence to treatment plans to maintain optimal cardiovascular health.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167048, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 187, "prompt_tokens": 172, "total_tokens": 359, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 108}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
