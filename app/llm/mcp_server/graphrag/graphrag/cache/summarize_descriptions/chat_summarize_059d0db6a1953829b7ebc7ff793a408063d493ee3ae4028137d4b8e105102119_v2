The study focuses on evaluating how various types of shoes influence mobility and energy consumption in this specific patient population, aiming to improve rehabilitation outcomes. FARMANI F's work contributes to understanding the practical considerations for footwear selection in post-stroke patients relying on AFOs, potentially enhancing their functional independence and quality of life. The research underscores the importance of footwear design in optimizing mobility and reducing energy demands during rehabilitation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752166949, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 125, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 326, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 0, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 201}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
