It is primarily valued for its ability to nourish yin and moisten dryness, making it a key component in formulations aimed at addressing conditions related to dehydration, dryness, or yin deficiency. In TCM, 沙参 is often incorporated into remedies to support respiratory health, alleviate dry cough, and promote overall hydration of the body.
