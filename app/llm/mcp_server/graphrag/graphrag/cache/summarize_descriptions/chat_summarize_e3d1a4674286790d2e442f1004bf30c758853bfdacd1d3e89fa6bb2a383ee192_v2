It encompasses dietary modifications, weight management, and increased physical activity to enhance blood sugar and blood pressure control. This intervention is recommended as a first-line strategy for low-risk hypertensive patients before considering medication, as well as for all individuals with isolated diastolic hypertension (IDH) to mitigate cardiovascular risks. Additionally, it is advised for untreated white coat hypertension patients to prevent progression to sustained hypertension. Overall, lifestyle intervention serves as a foundational, evidence-based method for managing and preventing chronic conditions through sustainable behavioral changes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559456, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 130, "prompt_tokens": 240, "total_tokens": 370, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 176}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
