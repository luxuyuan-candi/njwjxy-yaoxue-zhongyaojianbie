Clinical findings include active bowel sounds and the absence of abdominal tenderness or masses. It is classified under ICD-11 with the code **DD91.2**.  \n\n**Functional Dyspepsia (FDr)**, on the other hand, is a gastrointestinal disorder with an unclear etiology. Potential contributing factors include gastrointestinal motility abnormalities, heightened visceral sensitivity, intestinal flora imbalance, food allergies or intolerances, and psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, and depression.  \n\nWhile both conditions share the abbreviation \"FDr,\" they represent separate clinical entities with distinct diagnostic criteria and pathophysiological mechanisms. Functional Diarrhea primarily involves altered bowel habits without pain, whereas Functional Dyspepsia is associated with upper gastrointestinal symptoms and multifactorial causes. The term \"FDR\" should be clarified based on clinical context to avoid confusion between these two conditions.  \n\nThis summary reconciles the provided descriptions by distinguishing between the two disorders while acknowledging their shared medical and research framework.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167135, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 274, "prompt_tokens": 264, "total_tokens": 538, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 200}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
