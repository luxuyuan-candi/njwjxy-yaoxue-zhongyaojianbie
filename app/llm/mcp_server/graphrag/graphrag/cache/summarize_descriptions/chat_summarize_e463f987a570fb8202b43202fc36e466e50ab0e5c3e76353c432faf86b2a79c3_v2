They function by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, two neurotransmitters associated with mood regulation. SNRIs are widely recognized as an effective pharmacological option for managing depressive disorders.  \n\nWhile SNRIs are commonly prescribed for depression, some studies suggest they may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous miscarriage, though further research is needed to fully understand this potential risk. The class is also referred to by alternative names, including \"Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors\" and \"Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors,\" all of which describe the same group of medications.  \n\nIn summary, SNRIs are a well-established class of antidepressants with a primary role in depression treatment, though their use may carry certain risks that warrant careful consideration, particularly in specific populations such as pregnant individuals.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167566, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 229, "total_tokens": 441, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 165}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
