Their primary objectives include improving residual motor function, adapting motor skills, and enhancing overall quality of life for patients during recovery.  \n\n骨科矫形器 are utilized to support and correct musculoskeletal impairments, aiding in the restoration of movement and stability. By providing structural assistance, they help patients regain functional independence and mitigate the long-term effects of stroke-related disabilities. These devices are tailored to individual needs, ensuring optimal therapeutic outcomes in rehabilitation settings.  \n\nIn summary, 骨科矫形器 serve as essential tools in post-stroke care, combining orthopedic support with rehabilitative strategies to promote recovery and improve daily living for affected individuals.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752166949, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 187, "total_tokens": 361, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 0, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 187}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
