It is involved in the breakdown and processing of numerous pharmaceutical compounds, including certain beta-blockers, highlighting its importance in pharmacokinetics and drug efficacy. Additionally, CYP2D6 is known to be influenced by inhibitors, which can alter its activity and impact drug metabolism. This enzyme's function is essential for understanding drug interactions and individual variability in medication response. Overall, CYP2D6 serves as a key player in drug metabolism, with implications for both therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517982, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 121, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 302, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 117}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
