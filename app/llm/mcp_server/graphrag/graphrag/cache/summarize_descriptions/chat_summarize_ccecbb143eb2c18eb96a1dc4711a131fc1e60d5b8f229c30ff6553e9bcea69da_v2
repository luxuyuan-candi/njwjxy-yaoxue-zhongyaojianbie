It plays a significant role in the metabolism of various pharmaceuticals, including **R-warfarin** (as noted in the Chinese description: \"CYP2C19是一种代谢酶，主要参与R-华法林的代谢\"). Additionally, CYP2C19 is known to be influenced by inhibitors, which can alter its metabolic activity. The enzyme's function is critical in determining the efficacy and safety of certain drugs, making it an important focus in pharmacogenomics and clinical pharmacology.  \n\nThe descriptions provided are complementary rather than contradictory, with one emphasizing its general role in drug metabolism (including the presence of inhibitors) and the other specifying its involvement in metabolizing **R-warfarin**.
