This tear allows blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall, potentially leading to severe complications such as rupture or organ damage. It is often associated with hypertensive emergencies, where uncontrolled high blood pressure exacerbates the risk of aortic wall injury. Compared to other hypertension-related emergencies, aortic dissection demands more urgent and aggressive blood pressure management to prevent further tearing or catastrophic outcomes.
