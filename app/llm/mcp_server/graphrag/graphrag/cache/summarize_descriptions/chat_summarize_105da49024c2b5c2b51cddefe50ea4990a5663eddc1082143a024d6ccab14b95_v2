This condition primarily affects organs such as the heart, kidneys, and brain, which are highly susceptible to the detrimental effects of uncontrolled hypertension.  \n\nIn hypertensive emergencies, severely elevated blood pressure can lead to acute organ damage, posing immediate risks to the affected individual. Over time, chronic hypertension may also cause progressive harm to these organs, impairing their function and increasing the risk of complications such as heart failure, kidney disease, or stroke.  \n\nThe term encompasses both sudden, life-threatening damage and long-term structural or functional deterioration due to sustained high blood pressure. Early detection and management of hypertension are critical in preventing or mitigating 靶器官损害 and its associated health consequences.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167492, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 160, "prompt_tokens": 170, "total_tokens": 330, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 106}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
