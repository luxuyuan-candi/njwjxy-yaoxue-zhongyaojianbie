It is classified as a mood disorder and requires careful differential diagnosis to distinguish it from unipolar depression, as the treatment approaches differ.  \n\nThe depressive episodes involve symptoms such as persistent sadness, low energy, and loss of interest in activities, while manic or hypomanic episodes are characterized by elevated mood, increased energy, impulsivity, and sometimes risky behavior. The condition's key feature is the cyclical nature of these mood shifts, which can vary in intensity and duration.  \n\nBoth descriptions emphasize the importance of accurate diagnosis and management, as bipolar disorder involves distinct phases that necessitate tailored therapeutic interventions. The condition is chronic but manageable with appropriate treatment, including medication, psychotherapy, and lifestyle adjustments.  \n\n(Word count: 149)", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167565, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 174, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 370, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 132}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
