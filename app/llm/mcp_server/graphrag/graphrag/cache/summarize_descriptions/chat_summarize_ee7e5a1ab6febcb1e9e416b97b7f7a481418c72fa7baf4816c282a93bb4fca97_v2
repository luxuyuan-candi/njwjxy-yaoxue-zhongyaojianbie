They function by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, two neurotransmitters associated with mood regulation. SNRIs are among the commonly prescribed medications for depressive disorders due to their dual mechanism of action.  \n\nWhile effective for depression management, some studies suggest that SNRIs may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous miscarriage in pregnant individuals. This potential risk underscores the importance of careful consideration and consultation with healthcare providers when prescribing SNRIs to patients who are pregnant or planning pregnancy.  \n\nThe terms \"Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors\" and \"Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors\" are interchangeable, both referring to the same class of medications. SNRIs remain a widely recognized and utilized option in antidepressant therapy, though their use requires individualized assessment of benefits and risks, particularly in specific patient populations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517993, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 213, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 408, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 131}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
