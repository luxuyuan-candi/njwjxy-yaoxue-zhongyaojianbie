Core symptoms include emotional, physical, and cognitive disturbances such as fatigue, sleep disruptions, impaired social functioning, and, in severe cases, suicidal thoughts. The condition varies in intensity, classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on diagnostic criteria, and may present differently across age, gender, and cultural backgrounds.  \n\nDiagnosis involves a clinical evaluation to exclude other medical conditions, as there are no specific diagnostic methods. Depression often coexists with physical illnesses, with prevalence rates ranging from 9% to 33% depending on the underlying condition. Despite its high prevalence, treatment rates remain low, with fewer than 10% of patients receiving adequate care in many countries.  \n\nEffective management includes a combination of medication, lifestyle adjustments, and standardized treatment protocols to control symptoms, reduce relapse rates, and improve overall health outcomes. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical for better prognosis.
