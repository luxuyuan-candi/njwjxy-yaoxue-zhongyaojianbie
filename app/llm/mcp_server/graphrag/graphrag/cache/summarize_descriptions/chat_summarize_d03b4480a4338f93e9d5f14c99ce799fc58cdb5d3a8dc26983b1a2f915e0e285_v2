It is recognized as both a food and medicinal material in Chinese culture, particularly valued for its therapeutic properties.  \n\nIn traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), 橘皮 is commonly used to treat conditions related to phlegm-dampness accumulation and lipid metabolism disorders. It is specifically indicated for **high lipidemia (hyperlipidemia)** in individuals with patterns such as **phlegm-dampness obstruction (痰浊内阻型)**, **phlegm-stasis intermingling (痰瘀互结型)**, and **spleen deficiency with dampness excess (脾虚湿盛型)**. As a fundamental herb in lipid-lowering formulas, it works by **drying dampness, resolving phlegm, strengthening the spleen, and promoting turbid-descending functions to stop nausea and vomiting (燥湿化痰健脾，排浊降逆止呕)**.  \n\nBeyond its medicinal applications, 橘皮 is also used in cooking, where it adds flavor and potential digestive benefits to dishes. Its dual role as both a food and medicine underscores its importance in Chinese dietary therapy and holistic health practices.  \n\nThis summary integrates all provided descriptions, confirming 橘皮’s multifaceted use in TCM and cuisine without contradictions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517929, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 277, "prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 488, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 147}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
