It is defined as blood pressure that stays above the target goal even when a patient is on a concurrent regimen of three antihypertensive agents. In cases where standard therapies fail, treatments such as **aprocitentan** may be considered. This condition represents a challenging clinical scenario due to its resistance to conventional management strategies.  \n\nThe descriptions consistently emphasize that resistant hypertension involves the failure of multiple drug therapies to achieve blood pressure control, reinforcing its definition as a difficult-to-treat form of high blood pressure.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559450, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 136, "prompt_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 374, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 174}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
