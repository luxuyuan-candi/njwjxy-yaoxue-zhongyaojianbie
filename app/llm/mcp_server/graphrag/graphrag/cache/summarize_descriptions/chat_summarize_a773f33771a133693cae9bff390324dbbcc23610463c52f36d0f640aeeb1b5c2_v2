This clot often originates from **deep vein thrombosis (DVT)**, where a thrombus forms in the deep veins, typically in the legs, and travels to the pulmonary circulation. Pulmonary embolism is a well-documented complication in patients with **intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)** or **stroke**, as immobility and other risk factors associated with these conditions increase the likelihood of DVT formation.  \n\nThe condition poses a significant risk due to its potential to impair blood flow to the lungs, leading to severe respiratory and cardiovascular consequences. While the descriptions vary slightly in context—mentioning ICH patients, general DVT associations, and stroke patients—they collectively emphasize that pulmonary embolism is a critical secondary complication arising from venous thromboembolism. The underlying mechanism remains consistent: a dislodged clot from DVT migrates to the pulmonary arteries, causing obstruction.  \n\nTo resolve any minor discrepancies, the summary clarifies that pulmonary embolism can occur in various high-risk patient groups, including those with ICH, stroke, or other conditions predisposing them to DVT. The key takeaway is that pulmonary embolism is a dangerous and urgent medical event requiring prompt intervention to prevent fatal outcomes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167208, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 265, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 470, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 141}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
