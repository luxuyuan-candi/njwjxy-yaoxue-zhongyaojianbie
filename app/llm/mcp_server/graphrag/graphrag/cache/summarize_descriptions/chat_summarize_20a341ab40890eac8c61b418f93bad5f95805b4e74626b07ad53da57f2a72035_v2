It functions by modulating lipid metabolism, though the exact mechanism remains partially understood.  \n\nClofibrate is marketed under the brand name *Atromid-S* and is prescribed to manage hyperlipidemia, particularly in patients with high triglyceride levels. However, its use is accompanied by specific contraindications and potential side effects, which may include gastrointestinal disturbances, muscle pain, and, in rare cases, more severe reactions such as liver dysfunction or increased risk of gallstones. Due to these risks, its administration requires careful patient monitoring and adherence to prescribed guidelines.  \n\nWhile effective in lowering lipids, clofibrate has largely been replaced by newer fibrates with improved safety profiles. Nonetheless, it remains a recognized therapeutic option in certain clinical contexts. The drug should only be used under medical supervision, considering individual patient factors and potential drug interactions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167451, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 395, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 119}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
