Atherosclerosis occurs when excess cholesterol builds up in the arterial walls, forming plaques that narrow and harden the arteries. This restricts blood flow to the heart, increasing the risk of CHD, which can lead to complications such as angina, heart attacks, or heart failure. The relationship between high cholesterol and CHD is well-established, with elevated cholesterol levels directly promoting the progression of cardiovascular disease. Managing cholesterol through lifestyle changes or medication is often recommended to reduce the risk of developing or worsening coronary heart disease.  \n\n(Word count: 100)", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753518010, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 153, "prompt_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 331, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 114}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
