It is primarily prescribed for **spleen and stomach qi deficiency syndrome**, a condition characterized by weakened digestive function, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Additionally, **木香** is known for its ability to **relieve abdominal distension**, making it a valuable ingredient in remedies aimed at alleviating bloating and discomfort in the gastrointestinal tract.  \n\nAs a medicinal herb, **木香** plays a dual role in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): it helps strengthen the spleen and stomach while also addressing symptoms such as abdominal fullness and indigestion. Its applications reflect its importance in balancing qi (vital energy) and promoting digestive health.
