It is clinically used to lower triglycerides and cholesterol levels while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL), contributing to improved cardiovascular health. The formulation exhibits significant physiological activity in preventing atherosclerosis, inhibiting platelet aggregation, and delaying thrombus formation, thereby reducing the risk of thrombosis.  \n\nAs a therapeutic agent, 多烯康 combines lipid-regulating and anti-inflammatory properties, making it effective in managing hyperlipidemia and supporting vascular health. Its dual action on lipid metabolism and platelet function underscores its role in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The preparation is widely recognized in China for its natural composition and evidence-based benefits in reducing cardiovascular risk factors.  \n\nIn summary, 多烯康 is a comprehensive fish oil-based treatment that addresses elevated triglycerides, cholesterol imbalances, and thrombotic tendencies, offering a multifaceted approach to cardiovascular protection.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167452, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 204, "prompt_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 429, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 161}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
