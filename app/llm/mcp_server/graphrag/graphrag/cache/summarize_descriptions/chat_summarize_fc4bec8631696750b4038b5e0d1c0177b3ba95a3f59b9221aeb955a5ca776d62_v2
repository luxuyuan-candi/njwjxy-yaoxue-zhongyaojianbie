It is a highly purified form of ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a type of omega-3 fatty acid (ω-3脂肪酸类药物), and functions as a lipid-lowering agent.  \n\nAs a prescription drug, IPE is specifically formulated to reduce triglycerides in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia, particularly when combined with other risk factors for cardiovascular events. Its active component, EPA, contributes to its therapeutic effects by modulating lipid metabolism and reducing inflammation. IPE is distinct from other omega-3 fatty acid formulations due to its high purity and targeted mechanism of action.  \n\nIn clinical practice, IPE is often prescribed alongside statins or other lipid-regulating therapies to further mitigate cardiovascular risk. Its role in improving lipid profiles and potentially reducing ASCVD-related complications has been supported by clinical studies. Overall, IPE serves as a specialized treatment option for patients requiring focused triglyceride management within a broader cardiovascular risk reduction strategy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167346, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 225, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 407, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 118}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
