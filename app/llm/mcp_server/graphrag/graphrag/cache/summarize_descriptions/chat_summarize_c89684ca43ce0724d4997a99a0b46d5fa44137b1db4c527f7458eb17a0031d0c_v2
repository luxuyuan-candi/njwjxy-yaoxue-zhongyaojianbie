However, their use is associated with potential adverse effects, including the risk of **hypertension**, which may necessitate treatment with calcium channel blockers (CCBs), central antihypertensive drugs, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, or diuretics. Additionally, NSAIDs can contribute to **renal impairment**, particularly in patients with **chronic kidney disease (CKD)**, and are therefore advised to be used with caution or avoided in such individuals.
