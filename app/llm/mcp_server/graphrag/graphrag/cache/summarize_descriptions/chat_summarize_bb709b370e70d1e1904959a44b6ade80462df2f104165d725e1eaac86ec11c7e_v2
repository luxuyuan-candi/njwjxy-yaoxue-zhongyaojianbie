It is also associated with metabolic disturbances, including dyslipidemia. The condition can lead to elevated serum triglyceride levels due to increased hepatic lipoprotein synthesis and decreased lipid clearance. Additionally, nephrotic syndrome is recognized as a contributing factor in the development of late-stage hyperlipidemia, exacerbating lipid abnormalities over time. These lipid metabolism disruptions further complicate the clinical management of the syndrome, often necessitating targeted therapeutic interventions to address both renal and metabolic aspects of the disease.  \n\nIn summary, nephrotic syndrome not only impairs kidney function but also significantly impacts lipid metabolism, leading to elevated triglycerides and contributing to progressive hyperlipidemia in advanced stages.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517949, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 173, "total_tokens": 324, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 109}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
