It typically develops after 20 weeks of gestation and can progress to **eclampsia**, a life-threatening condition marked by seizures, if left untreated.  \n\nTo prevent or manage preeclampsia, **intravenous magnesium sulfate** is the first-line treatment for preventing or treating eclampsia. Additionally, **low-dose aspirin** may be recommended for high-risk patients as a preventive measure. The condition poses significant risks to both the mother and fetus, requiring close medical monitoring and timely intervention to mitigate complications.  \n\nWhile descriptions vary slightly in emphasis, they consistently highlight the core features of preeclampsia: hypertension, organ dysfunction (particularly renal involvement), and its potential escalation to eclampsia. Management strategies include both acute treatments (magnesium sulfate) and preventive measures (aspirin for high-risk individuals).", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559499, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 245, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 181}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
