It is primarily used to treat abdominal pain caused by cold, as well as to warm the middle *（middle jiao, referring to the spleen and stomach）* and dispel cold from the body. The formula is composed of key ingredients such as Sichuan pepper (*Huā Jiāo*), dried ginger (*Gān Jiāng*), and ginseng (*Rén Shēn*), which work synergistically to restore warmth and alleviate discomfort in the abdominal region.  \n\nThis herbal remedy is particularly effective for conditions stemming from internal cold, such as digestive disturbances, cramping, or pain due to deficient yang energy. By combining warming and tonifying herbs, 大建中汤 addresses both the symptoms and underlying imbalances, making it a well-regarded formula in classical Chinese medicine. Its therapeutic focus on dispelling cold while strengthening the middle jiao aligns with traditional principles of harmonizing the body's internal environment.  \n\nThe description remains consistent across sources, emphasizing its historical roots, clinical application, and composition, with no contradictions in the provided information.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167474, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 242, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 431, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 125}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
