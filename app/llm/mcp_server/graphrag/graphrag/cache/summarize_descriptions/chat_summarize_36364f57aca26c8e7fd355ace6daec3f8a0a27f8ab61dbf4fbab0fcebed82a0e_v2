Known scientifically as *Dioscorea*, it has been utilized for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for its health-promoting properties. As a dual-purpose **食药物质 (food-medicine substance)**, it is commonly incorporated into recipes not only for its nutritional value but also for its therapeutic benefits.  \n\nIn TCM, 山药 is valued for its ability to address various health conditions, particularly those related to metabolic and systemic imbalances. It is specifically noted for its applicability in managing **高脂血症 (hyperlipidemia)** of multiple patterns, including **痰浊内阻型 (phlegm-dampness obstruction)**, **痰瘀互结型 (phlegm-stasis combination)**, **气虚血瘀型 (qi deficiency with blood stasis)**, **肝肾阴虚型 (liver-kidney yin deficiency)**, and **脾虚湿盛型 (spleen deficiency with dampness excess)**. Its versatility in treating these conditions underscores its importance in herbal formulations and dietary therapy.  \n\nBeyond its medicinal uses, 山药 is a staple in Chinese cuisine, prized for its mild flavor and starchy texture. It is often prepared in soups, stews, or steamed dishes, blending seamlessly into both everyday meals and health-focused diets. Its dual role as a nourishing food and a healing herb makes it a cornerstone of holistic wellness practices in Chinese culture.  \n\nIn summary, 山药 is a multifaceted tuber with deep roots in traditional Chinese medicine and culinary traditions. Its applications span from addressing specific health disorders to serving as a dietary staple, embodying the principle of **\"医食同源\" (food as medicine)**. Whether consumed for its therapeutic effects or its nutritional benefits, 山药 remains a vital component of health and cuisine in Chinese society.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167285, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 390, "prompt_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 628, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 174}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
