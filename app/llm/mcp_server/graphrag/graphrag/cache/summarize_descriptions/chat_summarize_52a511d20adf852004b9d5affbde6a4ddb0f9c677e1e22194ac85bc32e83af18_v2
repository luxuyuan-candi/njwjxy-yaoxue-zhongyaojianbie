This condition is often associated with gout and hyperuricemia, which contribute to the excessive accumulation of uric acid in the body. The stones develop when uric acid crystallizes in the kidneys, leading to obstruction, pain, and potential complications if untreated. Both descriptions emphasize the role of high uric acid levels as the primary cause, linking the condition to metabolic disorders such as gout. The term \"尿酸性肾石症\" is the Chinese equivalent of \"uric acid nephrolithiasis,\" further clarifying its definition in a multilingual context.
