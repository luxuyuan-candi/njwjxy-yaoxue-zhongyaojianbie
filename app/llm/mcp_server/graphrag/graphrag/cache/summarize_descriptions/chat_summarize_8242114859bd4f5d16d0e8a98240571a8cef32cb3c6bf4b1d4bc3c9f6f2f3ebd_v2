These inhibitors, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, are used in lipid-lowering treatments, particularly for patients with extremely high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who cannot tolerate other cholesterol-lowering medications. By binding to PCSK9, these inhibitors prevent the degradation of LDL receptors, thereby enhancing the liver's ability to remove LDL-C from the bloodstream. PCSK9 inhibitors represent an important therapeutic option for managing elevated cholesterol levels in high-risk populations. The protein itself is a proprotein convertase, and its inhibition has been shown to significantly reduce LDL-C, contributing to improved cardiovascular outcomes. Overall, PCSK9 serves as a critical target for pharmacological interventions aimed at lowering cholesterol and mitigating cardiovascular risk.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167227, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 195, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 437, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 178}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
