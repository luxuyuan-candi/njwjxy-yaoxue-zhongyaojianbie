Their work includes a systematic analysis of mortality and morbidity in China, as well as investigations into dietary and lifestyle factors influencing hypertension. Notably, they studied the association between spicy food consumption frequency and hypertension in Zhejiang province, with findings published in *Nutrition & Metabolism* in 2021.  \n\nAdditionally, WANG H has contributed to research on sodium intake assessment methods, including evaluating the applicability of a Japanese salt questionnaire in a Chinese hypertensive population. They also developed a technique for estimating 24-hour urinary sodium excretion using casual urine specimens in hypertensive patients and explored the relationship between chewing salt threshold tablets and salt intake.  \n\nOverall, WANG H's research spans epidemiological analysis, dietary influences on hypertension, and innovative methodologies for measuring sodium consumption in at-risk populations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559550, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 175, "prompt_tokens": 245, "total_tokens": 420, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 181}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
