These techniques are widely recommended for further evaluation in patients who exhibit positive results on initial screening tests, such as the water swallow test, with strong supporting evidence (Ⅰ级推荐, A级证据).  \n\nVFSS, often considered the gold standard, utilizes real-time X-ray imaging to visualize the swallowing mechanism, providing detailed insights into bolus movement and structural abnormalities. FEES, on the other hand, employs a flexible endoscope to directly observe pharyngeal and laryngeal structures during swallowing, offering a viable alternative to VFSS in cases where radiation exposure is a concern or when bedside assessment is preferred. While both methods serve the same primary purpose—evaluating swallowing safety and efficiency—they differ in their approach, advantages, and limitations.  \n\nFEES is particularly useful for detecting residue, aspiration, and pharyngeal motility issues without radiation, making it suitable for repeated assessments. VFSS, however, provides a dynamic view of the entire swallowing process, including the oral and esophageal phases, which FEES cannot fully capture. Despite these differences, both are endorsed as reliable diagnostic tools, with the choice between them often depending on clinical context, patient-specific factors, and resource availability.  \n\nIn summary, VFSS and FEES are complementary, evidence-based methods for swallowing evaluation, each with distinct strengths. Their combined use or selective application ensures comprehensive assessment and tailored management for patients with dysphagia.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753518022, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 349, "prompt_tokens": 223, "total_tokens": 572, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 159}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
