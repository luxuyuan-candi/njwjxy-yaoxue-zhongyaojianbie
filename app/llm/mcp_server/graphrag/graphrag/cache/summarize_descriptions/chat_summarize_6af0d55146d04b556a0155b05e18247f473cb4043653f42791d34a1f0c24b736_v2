It is a key ingredient in the **银翘散** (Yinqiao San) formula, a classic TCM prescription often employed to address respiratory conditions such as sore throat and cough.  \n\nIn addition to its role in respiratory health, 桔梗 is recognized as a **食药物质** (food-medicine substance), making it suitable for dietary and medicinal use. It is particularly recommended for individuals with **痰浊内阻型** (phlegm-dampness obstruction) or **痰瘀互结型** (phlegm-stasis combination) hyperlipidemia, where it aids in regulating lipid metabolism and alleviating related symptoms.  \n\nOverall, 桔梗 serves as a versatile TCM herb, valued for its efficacy in treating respiratory ailments and managing specific metabolic disorders, while also being incorporated into functional food applications.
