It plays a crucial part in cardiovascular health by aiding in the clearance of excess cholesterol. Additionally, certain compounds like niacin (烟酸) have been shown to increase HDL-C levels, further supporting its beneficial effects. The term \"HDL-C\" is universally recognized, whether referenced in English (\"High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol\") or Chinese (\"高密度脂蛋白胆固醇\").
