It is employed in clinical settings to track blood pressure fluctuations throughout the day, providing a more comprehensive assessment than single in-clinic measurements. ABPM is particularly useful for diagnosing and confirming conditions such as resistant hypertension, as it captures blood pressure readings in a patient's natural environment, outside the clinic. This approach helps mitigate the \"white coat effect\" (elevated blood pressure due to clinical settings) and offers a more accurate representation of a patient's cardiovascular health. By combining continuous monitoring with real-world conditions, ABPM serves as a valuable tool for healthcare providers in evaluating and managing hypertension.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167070, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 342, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 65}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
