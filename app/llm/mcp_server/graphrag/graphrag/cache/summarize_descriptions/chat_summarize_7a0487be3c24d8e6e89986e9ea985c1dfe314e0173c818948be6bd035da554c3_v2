This process helps protect against the buildup of arterial plaque and reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases. HDL is considered beneficial due to its ability to transport excess cholesterol to the liver for excretion, thereby maintaining healthier cholesterol levels.  \n\nNormal HDL levels typically range between **0.9–2.19 mmol/L (35–85 mg/dL)**, with higher levels generally associated with better heart health. Maintaining adequate HDL levels is an important factor in managing overall cholesterol balance and mitigating the risks of conditions like atherosclerosis and heart disease.  \n\nIn summary, HDL is a vital component of lipid metabolism, recognized for its protective effects against cardiovascular diseases by facilitating the removal of harmful cholesterol from the circulatory system.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167385, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 183, "prompt_tokens": 216, "total_tokens": 399, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 152}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
