It is typically prescribed in doses of 0.3 or 0.6 grams per administration, taken twice daily. As a fibrate, it primarily functions to reduce elevated lipid levels, including triglycerides and cholesterol, thereby aiding in cardiovascular risk management. The drug is widely recognized for its role in improving lipid profiles and is commonly used in clinical practice.  \n\nThe descriptions confirm that bezafibrate belongs to the fibrate class of drugs and is utilized for its lipid-modulating effects. While one description specifies its dosage regimen (0.3 or 0.6 g twice daily), the other broadly categorizes it as a lipid-lowering agent. There are no contradictions between the provided descriptions; rather, they complement each other by detailing both its classification and dosing information.  \n\nIn summary, bezafibrate is an oral fibrate medication used to treat lipid disorders, with a standard dosing protocol of 0.3 or 0.6 grams twice daily.
