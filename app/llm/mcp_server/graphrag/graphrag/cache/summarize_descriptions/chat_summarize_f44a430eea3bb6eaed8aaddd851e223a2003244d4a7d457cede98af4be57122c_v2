It is a major medical condition studied in research on beta-blocker efficacy and is included in ASCVD risk classification. Hypertension is a significant risk factor for myocardial infarction, and elevated blood pressure levels increase the likelihood of such events. When combined with hypertension, myocardial infarction can lead to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Additionally, it is one of the conditions where angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are particularly effective. Post-myocardial infarction management often involves the use of angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) and other medications to improve outcomes.  \n\nThis summary integrates all provided descriptions into a coherent overview, resolving any overlaps or contradictions by consolidating related information.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559443, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 178, "prompt_tokens": 268, "total_tokens": 446, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 204}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
