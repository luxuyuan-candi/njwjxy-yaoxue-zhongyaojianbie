Established as a key authority in rheumatology, the ACR has developed classification criteria for gout, first introduced in 1977 and later updated in 2015 through a collaboration with the **European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)**. These criteria serve as standardized guidelines for diagnosing and classifying gout, ensuring consistency in clinical practice and research.  \n\nIn addition to classification criteria, the ACR provides comprehensive guidelines for gout management, which include evidence-based recommendations for urate-lowering therapy (ULT). These guidelines aim to optimize patient care by outlining best practices for treatment and long-term disease management. The organization’s work underscores its role in shaping clinical standards, fostering research, and promoting collaboration with international rheumatology societies like EULAR.  \n\nBy combining diagnostic classification with therapeutic guidance, the ACR plays a pivotal role in improving outcomes for individuals with gout and other rheumatic conditions. Its contributions reflect a commitment to evidence-based medicine and multidisciplinary approaches in rheumatology.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752166965, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 227, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 448, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 157}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
