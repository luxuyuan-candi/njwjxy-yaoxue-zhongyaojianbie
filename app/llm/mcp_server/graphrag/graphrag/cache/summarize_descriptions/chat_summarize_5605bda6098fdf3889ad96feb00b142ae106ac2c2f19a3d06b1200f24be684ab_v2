It is particularly valuable in assessing cases where treatment resistance is suspected, providing reliable and consistent measurements outside of clinical settings.  \n\nTo confirm a diagnosis of resistant hypertension, HBPM is required, as it helps rule out white-coat hypertension (elevated readings in medical environments) and ensures accurate monitoring of a patient's blood pressure over time. By incorporating HBPM into diagnostic protocols, healthcare providers can better distinguish true resistant hypertension from other confounding factors, leading to more effective treatment strategies.  \n\nIn summary, HBPM serves as an essential tool for both evaluating and confirming resistant hypertension, ensuring accurate diagnosis and informed clinical decision-making.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167627, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 168, "total_tokens": 340, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 104}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
