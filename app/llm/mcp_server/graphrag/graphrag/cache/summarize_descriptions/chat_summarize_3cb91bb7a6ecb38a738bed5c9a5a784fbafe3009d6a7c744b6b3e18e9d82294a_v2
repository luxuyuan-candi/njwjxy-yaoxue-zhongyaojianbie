It is a key biomarker in cardiovascular health, as elevated levels can lead to buildup in the arteries, contributing to atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular conditions. LDL-C is the primary target for lipid-lowering therapies, including medications such as PCSK9 inhibitors (e.g., inclisiran), statins (e.g.,血脂康 [Xuezhikang]), and other treatments aimed at reducing its levels in hypertensive patients and those at risk for cardiovascular disease.
