LDL acts as a transporter, moving cholesterol from the liver and intestines to body tissues. However, when excessive, it deposits cholesterol on artery walls, narrowing and hardening them over time. This process increases the risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes.  \n\nLDL can become oxidized when exposed to harmful substances like cigarette smoke, further exacerbating its damaging effects on arterial health. Lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise, weight loss, quitting smoking, and dietary changes (such as consuming soybeans and other cholesterol-lowering foods), can help reduce LDL levels.  \n\nWhile LDL is essential for transporting cholesterol, its overaccumulation poses significant health risks, making its management crucial for preventing cardiovascular disease.
