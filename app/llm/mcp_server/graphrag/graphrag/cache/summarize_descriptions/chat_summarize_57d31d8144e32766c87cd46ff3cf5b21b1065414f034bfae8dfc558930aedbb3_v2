Initiated to track cardiovascular health over time, the study has investigated the association between blood pressure and coronary heart disease risk, particularly as participants age. A key publication from the study in *Circulation* (2001) examined this relationship in depth. Additionally, the study has assessed lifetime risks for developing congestive heart failure, providing critical insights into long-term cardiovascular health outcomes.
