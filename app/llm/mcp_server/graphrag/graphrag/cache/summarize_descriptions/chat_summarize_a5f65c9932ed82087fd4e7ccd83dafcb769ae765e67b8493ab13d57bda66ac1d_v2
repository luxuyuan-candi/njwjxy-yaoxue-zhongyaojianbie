Notably, Kossmehl P co-authored a study on early botulinum toxin treatment for spastic pes equinovarus, published in the *European Journal of Neurology (Eur J Neurol)* in 2014. This work highlights their involvement in investigating therapeutic interventions for post-stroke spasticity, particularly focusing on the timing and efficacy of botulinum toxin administration. Their research underscores a broader interest in stroke rehabilitation techniques, aiming to improve patient outcomes through innovative approaches. Overall, Kossmehl P's contributions reflect expertise in neurology and rehabilitation, with a specific focus on spasticity management following stroke.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167581, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 147, "prompt_tokens": 190, "total_tokens": 337, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 126}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
