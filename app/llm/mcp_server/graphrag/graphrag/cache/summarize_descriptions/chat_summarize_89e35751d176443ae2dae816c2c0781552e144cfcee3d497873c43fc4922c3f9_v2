This condition is strongly associated with hypertension (high blood pressure), and their coexistence can exacerbate cardiovascular complications. In particular, when combined with hypertension, CAD may contribute to the development of **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**, a serious condition where the heart's ability to pump blood is impaired. Overall, CAD is a significant health concern due to its role in restricting blood flow to the heart and its potential to worsen when paired with other risk factors like hypertension.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559445, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 305, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 113}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
