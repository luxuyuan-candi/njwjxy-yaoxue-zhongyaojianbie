Among its many functions, the FDA evaluates and categorizes substances for their safety, including designating certain ingredients as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS). For instance, in 2000, the FDA listed diacylglycerol oil as a GRAS substance, indicating its approval for use in food products based on scientific evidence. Additionally, the FDA assesses the safety of pharmaceuticals, such as antidepressants, and provides guidance on their use during pregnancy, categorizing them based on potential risks and benefits. Through these regulatory actions, the FDA plays a critical role in protecting public health by ensuring the safety of consumable and medical products.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167469, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 365, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 130}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
