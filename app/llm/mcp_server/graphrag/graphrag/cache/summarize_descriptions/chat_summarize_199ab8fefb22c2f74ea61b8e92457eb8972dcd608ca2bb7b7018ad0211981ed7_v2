The condition is associated with elevated serum triglyceride levels, contributing to metabolic disturbances. Additionally, Cushing Syndrome is recognized as a potential cause of depression-like symptoms, highlighting its impact on both physical and mental health. The disorder arises from prolonged exposure to high cortisol, whether due to endogenous overproduction or exogenous sources, and its manifestations often require comprehensive medical evaluation and management.  \n\nIn summary, Cushing Syndrome presents as a multifaceted condition affecting metabolic and mental health, with key features including dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides) and mood-related symptoms such as depression.
