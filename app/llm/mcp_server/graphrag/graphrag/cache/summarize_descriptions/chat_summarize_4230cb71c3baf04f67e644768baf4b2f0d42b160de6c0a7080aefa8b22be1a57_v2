It is available in multiple formulations, including immediate-release, sustained-release, and controlled-release versions, allowing for tailored dosing regimens based on clinical needs. As a calcium channel blocker, it works by inhibiting calcium ion influx into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac cells, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure.
