This tearing can lead to a separation (dissection) of the aortic wall layers, which may result in complications such as stenosis (narrowing of the artery) or life-threatening bleeding. The condition is frequently associated with high blood pressure, which exacerbates the risk of further tearing or rupture. Immediate medical intervention, including rapid and significant blood pressure reduction, is often required to stabilize the patient and prevent worsening of the dissection. Aortic dissection demands urgent treatment due to its high mortality risk if left unmanaged.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559508, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 131, "prompt_tokens": 198, "total_tokens": 329, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 134}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
