The gout classification criteria established by the ACR serve as an important diagnostic tool in rheumatology and have been utilized internationally, demonstrating their influence in both Western and Chinese medical research. The **中华内科杂志**'s reference to the ACR's 1977 criteria highlights their continued relevance and application in clinical practice and academic discussions.
