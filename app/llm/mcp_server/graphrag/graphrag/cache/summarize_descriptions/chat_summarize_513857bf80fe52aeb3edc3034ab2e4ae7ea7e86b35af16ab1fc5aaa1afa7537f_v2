It serves as a raw material for the production of steroid hormones and bile acids, playing a critical role in various physiological processes. While cholesterol is necessary for building cells and synthesizing vital hormones, excessive levels can contribute to cardiovascular diseases, particularly in individuals with hyperlipidemia (high lipid levels).  \n\nDietary cholesterol is found in animal-based foods, including egg yolks, organ meats (such as liver and brains), fatty cuts of meat, fish roe, and high-fat dairy products like cream. Due to its association with cardiovascular risk, intake should be carefully monitored, especially for those following a low-fat or heart-healthy diet. However, not all cholesterol is harmfulâ€”its biological functions underscore its importance in moderation.  \n\nIn summary, cholesterol is a dual-natured substance: vital for cellular and hormonal functions but potentially detrimental when present in excess.
