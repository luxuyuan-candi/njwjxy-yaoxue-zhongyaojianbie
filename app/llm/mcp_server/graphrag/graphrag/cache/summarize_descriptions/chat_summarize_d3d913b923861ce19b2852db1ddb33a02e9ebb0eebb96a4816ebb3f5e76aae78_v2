While effective, TCAS are known to have significant anticholinergic effects, which can lead to dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and cognitive impairment, particularly in elderly patients. Additionally, they carry a risk of cardiac toxicity, including arrhythmias and hypotension, making them generally unsuitable for older individuals or those with preexisting heart conditions.  \n\nDespite these limitations, TCAS remain a viable option for certain patients, especially when first-line treatments (such as SSRIs or SNRIs) are ineffective. Their use is carefully monitored to balance therapeutic benefits against potential adverse effects. Overall, TCAS represent an important but cautiously utilized tool in the management of depression, particularly in cases where alternative treatments have failed.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517994, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 200, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 381, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 117}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
