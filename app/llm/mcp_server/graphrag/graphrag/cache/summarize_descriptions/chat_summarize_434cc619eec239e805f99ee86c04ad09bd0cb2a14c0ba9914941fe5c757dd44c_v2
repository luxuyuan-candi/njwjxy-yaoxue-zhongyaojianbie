This overproduction leads to hypertension (high blood pressure) and often results in **hypokalemia** (low potassium levels). Key features of the condition include elevated aldosterone levels, suppressed renin activity, and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. While hypokalemia is a common symptom, not all patients may present with it. The disorder is a significant cause of secondary hypertension and requires careful diagnosis and management to mitigate long-term complications.  \n\n*(Note: The descriptions were consistent, reinforcing the same core features—excessive aldosterone, hypertension, hypokalemia, and cardiovascular risks—without contradictions.)*", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559510, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 157, "prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 368, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 147}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
