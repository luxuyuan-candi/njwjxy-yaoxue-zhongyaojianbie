It is a key ingredient in formulations such as **桑菊饮** (Sang Ju Yin), a classic TCM formula. Known for its therapeutic properties, 桑叶 is particularly noted for its applicability in managing **肝肾阴虚型** (liver and kidney yin deficiency) and **脾虚湿盛型** (spleen deficiency with dampness accumulation) patterns of hyperlipidemia.  \n\nAs a versatile herbal component, 桑叶 is incorporated into various TCM remedies, highlighting its role in promoting health and addressing specific imbalances. Its dual classification as a **食药物质** (food-medicine substance) underscores its safety and efficacy for dietary and medicinal use. The leaf is derived from the mulberry plant (*Morus alba*), further emphasizing its natural origin and longstanding integration into traditional practices.  \n\nIn summary, 桑叶 is a multifunctional herb in TCM, valued for its inclusion in therapeutic formulas, its role in managing hyperlipidemia, and its status as a safe, edible medicinal resource.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167286, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 241, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 442, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 137}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
