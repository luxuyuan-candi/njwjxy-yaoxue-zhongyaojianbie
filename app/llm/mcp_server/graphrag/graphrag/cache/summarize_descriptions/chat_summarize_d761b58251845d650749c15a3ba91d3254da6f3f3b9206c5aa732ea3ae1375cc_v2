It is metabolized by the enzyme CYP2C19, which also plays a key role in the activation of the antiplatelet drug clopidogrel (硫酸氢氯吡格雷). When omeprazole and clopidogrel are taken together, omeprazole competes with clopidogrel for CYP2C19 metabolism, thereby reducing the effectiveness of clopidogrel. This interaction is clinically significant, as it may diminish clopidogrel's antiplatelet effects, potentially increasing the risk of cardiovascular events in patients relying on clopidogrel for thrombosis prevention.  \n\nBoth descriptions highlight this pharmacokinetic interaction, emphasizing that concurrent use of omeprazole and clopidogrel should be carefully considered, and alternative PPIs with less CYP2C19 inhibition (such as pantoprazole) may be preferred in patients requiring clopidogrel therapy.
