It functions by modulating serotonin levels in the brain, which helps regulate mood, and it has been noted to increase vascular sensitivity as part of its pharmacological effects. However, FLUVOXAMINE is classified as a **pregnancy category C** medication, indicating potential risks to the fetus if used during pregnancy. While it is an effective treatment for depression, its use in pregnant individuals requires careful consideration and medical supervision due to possible adverse effects.  \n\nThis summary integrates both descriptions, clarifying FLUVOXAMINE's mechanism of action (serotonin modulation and vascular effects) alongside its safety considerations during pregnancy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559401, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 155, "total_tokens": 304, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 91}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
