CVD encompasses a range of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, and while it poses a serious threat, it can often be prevented or delayed through proactive lifestyle modifications. Key preventive measures include maintaining a healthy diet and engaging in regular physical activity, as highlighted in guidance for individuals with hypertension and dyslipidemia. By addressing these modifiable risk factors, patients can reduce their likelihood of developing CVD or slow its progression.
