It is a highly purified form of ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a type of omega-3 fatty acid, and functions as a lipid-lowering agent. IPE is specifically formulated to reduce triglycerides without significantly increasing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, making it a targeted therapeutic option for individuals with persistent hypertriglyceridemia despite statin therapy.  \n\nThe medication is derived from fish oil and contains no docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), distinguishing it from other omega-3-based treatments. Clinical studies have demonstrated that IPE not only lowers triglycerides but also reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in high-risk patients. Its mechanism of action involves modulating lipid metabolism, reducing inflammation, and improving endothelial function.  \n\nIPE is typically prescribed as an adjunct to diet and statin therapy in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (â‰¥500 mg/dL) or as a secondary prevention measure in those with established cardiovascular disease or diabetes and additional risk factors. By combining triglyceride management with cardiovascular risk reduction, IPE serves as a specialized treatment for patients requiring comprehensive lipid control.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517944, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 260, "prompt_tokens": 175, "total_tokens": 435, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 111}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
