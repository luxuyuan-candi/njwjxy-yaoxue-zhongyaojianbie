It is a component in TCM prescriptions aimed at treating hyperlipidemia, a condition characterized by elevated levels of lipids in the blood. In such formulations, it helps alleviate associated symptoms like dizziness and insomnia. Additionally, **北沙参** is employed to address thirst, likely due to its purported hydrating or nourishing properties in TCM theory.  \n\nThe herb’s dual role—both in managing metabolic conditions like hyperlipidemia and in relieving thirst—highlights its versatility in traditional remedies. While the descriptions emphasize different uses, there is no contradiction; rather, they reflect the broad spectrum of applications for **北沙参** within TCM practices. Its inclusion in prescriptions underscores its importance as a supportive ingredient for both systemic and symptomatic relief.  \n\nIn summary, **北沙参** serves as a multifunctional herb in TCM, contributing to treatments for hyperlipidemia and its related symptoms, as well as aiding in thirst relief, demonstrating its adaptability in various therapeutic contexts.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167464, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 220, "prompt_tokens": 175, "total_tokens": 395, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 111}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
