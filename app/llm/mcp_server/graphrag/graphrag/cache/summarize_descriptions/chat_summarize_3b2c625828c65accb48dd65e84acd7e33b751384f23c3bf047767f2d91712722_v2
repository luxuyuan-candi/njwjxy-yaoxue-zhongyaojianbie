EULAR collaborates extensively with other leading institutions, such as the **American College of Rheumatology (ACR)**, to develop and refine classification criteria for various rheumatic conditions.  \n\nIn 2015, EULAR partnered with the ACR to establish updated classification criteria for **gout**, a common form of inflammatory arthritis. This collaboration aimed to standardize diagnostic practices and improve clinical outcomes. Building on this work, in 2018, EULAR further recommended a **three-step diagnostic approach** for gout, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis.  \n\nEULAR plays a key role in fostering international cooperation in rheumatology, ensuring that classification standards and treatment guidelines remain evidence-based and widely applicable. Its efforts contribute significantly to the global rheumatology community by promoting best practices and facilitating research advancements.  \n\n(Note: The organization is referred to by two names—**European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology** and **European League Against Rheumatism**—which are used interchangeably in the provided descriptions.
