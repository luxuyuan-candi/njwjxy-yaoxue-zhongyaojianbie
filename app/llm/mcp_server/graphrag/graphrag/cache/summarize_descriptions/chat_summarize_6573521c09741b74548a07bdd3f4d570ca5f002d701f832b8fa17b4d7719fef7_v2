It is a type of hyperlipidemia and a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and stroke. The condition often occurs in middle-aged and elderly individuals, as well as those with obesity, unhealthy diets, or a family history of hypertension or high cholesterol.  \n\nHigh cholesterol can be classified as primary (genetic) or secondary (caused by underlying diseases or medications). It frequently coexists with hypertension, further increasing the risk of severe complications such as arterial hardening, heart attacks, and strokes. Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is particularly concerning due to its strong association with coronary heart disease.  \n\nManagement of high cholesterol includes dietary therapy, herbal preparations, and lifestyle modifications. It is a primary focus of dietary interventions aimed at reducing lipid levels and mitigating cardiovascular risks.
