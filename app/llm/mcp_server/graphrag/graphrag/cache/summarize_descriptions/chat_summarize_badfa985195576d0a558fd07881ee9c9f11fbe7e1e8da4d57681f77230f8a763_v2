It promotes atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty plaques in the arteries, which narrows and hardens them, impairing blood flow to the heart. Additionally, obesity leads to metabolic dysfunction, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and chronic inflammation, all of which further exacerbate the risk of CHD.  \n\nResearch consistently shows that obesity increases the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease, underscoring the importance of weight management in cardiovascular health. By addressing obesity through lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, individuals can reduce their risk of CHD and its associated complications.  \n\nIn summary, obesity plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease by driving atherosclerosis and metabolic disturbances, making it a key modifiable risk factor for prevention and treatment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167758, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 187, "prompt_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 364, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 49}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
