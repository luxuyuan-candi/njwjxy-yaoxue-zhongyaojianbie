Known scientifically as *Coix lacryma-jobi*, it serves both as a medicinal herb and a functional food ingredient. In TCM, 薏苡仁 is valued for its therapeutic properties, particularly in addressing conditions related to dampness and phlegm accumulation. It is commonly incorporated into herbal formulations to support health, such as in recipes targeting specific patterns of dyslipidemia (high cholesterol or triglycerides).  \n\nAs a **food-medicine substance**, 薏苡仁 is specifically recommended for individuals with certain TCM diagnostic patterns, including:  \n- **痰浊内阻型 (Phlegm-dampness obstruction)**  \n- **痰瘀互结型 (Phlegm-stasis intermingling)**  \n- **气虚血瘀型 (Qi deficiency with blood stasis)**  \n- **脾虚湿盛型 (Spleen deficiency with dampness excess)**  \n\nIts dual role underscores its importance in promoting wellness through dietary and medicinal applications. The grain is often prepared in soups, congees, or herbal decoctions to harness its purported benefits, such as resolving dampness, strengthening the spleen, and improving metabolic imbalances. While referred to interchangeably as \"coix seed\" in English, its traditional use remains deeply rooted in Chinese herbalism and holistic health practices.  \n\nThis consolidated description harmonizes the provided information, emphasizing 薏苡仁's multifaceted applications without contradiction. Its classification as both a medicinal herb and a functional food highlights its integration into daily health management in TCM contexts.  \n\n*(Word count: 199)*", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517930, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 342, "prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 553, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 147}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
