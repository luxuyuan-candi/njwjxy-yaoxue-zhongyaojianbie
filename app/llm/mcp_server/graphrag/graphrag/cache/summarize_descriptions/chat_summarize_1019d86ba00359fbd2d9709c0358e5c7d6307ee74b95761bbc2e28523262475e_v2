Primarily, it serves as a diagnostic measure for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) by comparing blood pressure readings in the arms (brachial artery) and legs (ankle arteries). Additionally, ABI is recognized as a predictor of cardiovascular risk, helping identify patients at higher risk for cardiovascular events. While one description mentions its use in detecting aortic stenosis, its most established and widely accepted application is in evaluating PAD and broader cardiovascular risk assessment.
