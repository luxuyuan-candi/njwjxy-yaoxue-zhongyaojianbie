It is notably included in soups aimed at managing high lipidemia (elevated blood lipid levels), as its consumption is believed to contribute to lipid regulation. Additionally, carp is listed in food exchange tables, where it is categorized with a recommended portion size of **60â€“90 grams per serving**, equivalent to **one piece** of fish. This standardized portion ensures controlled intake, making it a practical option for meal planning, especially in dietary regimens focused on portion control and nutritional balance.  \n\nIn summary, carp serves both as a functional food for lipid management and a measured dietary component, aligning with health-conscious eating practices.
