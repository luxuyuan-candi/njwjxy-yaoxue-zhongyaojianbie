It is notably involved in the breakdown of **irbesartan**, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) used as an antihypertensive, as well as **S-warfarin**, a key anticoagulant. The enzyme's activity is essential for determining the efficacy and safety of these medications, as variations in CYP2C9 function can significantly alter drug clearance rates.  \n\nCYP2C9 is also subject to inhibition by certain compounds, which can reduce its metabolic activity. This inhibition is particularly clinically relevant for drugs like warfarin, where decreased CYP2C9 activity can lead to prolonged anticoagulant effects and an increased risk of bleeding. The enzyme's role in warfarin metabolism is well-documented, with genetic polymorphisms and drug interactions influencing its function.  \n\nThe descriptions highlight CYP2C9's dual involvement in metabolizing both antihypertensive and anticoagulant drugs, emphasizing its importance in pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine. While some descriptions focus on specific substrates (e.g., irbesartan or warfarin), others underscore its broader role in drug metabolism and susceptibility to inhibitors. There are no direct contradictions, but the combined information clarifies that CYP2C9 has multiple drug substrates and its inhibition can have significant clinical consequences, particularly for narrow-therapeutic-index drugs like warfarin.  \n\nIn summary, CYP2C9 is a vital metabolic enzyme with a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of several medications, including irbesartan and warfarin. Its activity can be modulated by inhibitors, and genetic or pharmacological alterations in its function may necessitate dose adjustments to avoid adverse effects.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167224, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 350, "prompt_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 588, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 174}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
