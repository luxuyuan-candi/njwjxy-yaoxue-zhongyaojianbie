It is a leading cause of death globally, particularly in China, where it accounts for over 45% of total deaths.  \n\nThe disease is influenced by multiple risk factors, including high blood pressure (both isolated systolic hypertension [ISH] and increased diastolic pressure [IDH]), elevated cholesterol levels, smoking, and physical inactivity. Hypertension, in particular, is strongly correlated with cardiovascular disease, as elevated systolic pressure increases mortality and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, while IDH is linked to higher risks of cerebral hemorrhage, cardiovascular mortality, and other complications, especially in younger patients.  \n\nLifestyle modifications and medical interventions can mitigate risks. Smoking cessation reduces cardiovascular disease risk, while medications such as SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) have been shown to lower the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. Effective blood pressure management is also crucial in reducing the incidence and severity of cardiovascular disease.  \n\nOverall, cardiovascular disease represents a major public health challenge, with prevention and treatment strategies focusing on controlling modifiable risk factors and utilizing targeted therapies.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559442, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 261, "prompt_tokens": 429, "total_tokens": 690, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 365}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
