It is recognized as both a medicinal and edible substance (食药物质), particularly suitable for addressing conditions such as excessive sweating and气虚血瘀型高脂血症 (hyperlipidemia due to qi deficiency and blood stasis).  \n\nIn clinical applications, 黄芪 is often incorporated into formulas to strengthen the spleen, replenish qi (健脾益气), and support the body's immune function. It serves as a foundational herb in treatments for hyperlipidemia, where it helps regulate immune responses and corrects imbalances associated with qi deficiency. Additionally, its inclusion in prescriptions aims to mitigate symptoms like excessive sweating, reflecting its role in stabilizing bodily functions.  \n\nOverall, 黄芪 is valued in traditional Chinese medicine for its dual role in promoting wellness and treating specific ailments, particularly those linked to qi deficiency, immune dysregulation, and metabolic disorders like hyperlipidemia. Its versatility as both a therapeutic and dietary ingredient underscores its importance in holistic health practices.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517934, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 422, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 146}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
