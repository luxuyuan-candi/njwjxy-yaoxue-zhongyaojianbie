It is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulations to address conditions related to blood stasis and circulatory issues. As a dual-purpose food and medicinal substance (食药物质), 桃仁 is specifically indicated for managing hyperlipidemia, particularly in cases classified as \"phlegm-stasis mutual binding\" (痰瘀互结型) and \"qi stagnation with blood stasis\" (气滞血瘀型). Its therapeutic applications stem from its ability to invigorate blood flow, resolve stasis, and alleviate related symptoms. In TCM practice, 桃仁 is often incorporated into herbal recipes to enhance its synergistic effects with other ingredients, further supporting its role in holistic health management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167285, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 165, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 356, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 127}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
