They function by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which helps lower blood pressure. However, their use may carry an increased risk of angioedema (a rapid swelling beneath the skin) when combined with DPP-4 inhibitors, another class of medications. While effective for managing high blood pressure, healthcare providers should be cautious about potential adverse interactions, particularly with DPP-4 inhibitors, to mitigate the risk of angioedema. This dual role—as a key antihypertensive therapy with a noted interaction risk—highlights the importance of careful medication management when prescribing ACE inhibitors.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167493, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 152, "prompt_tokens": 196, "total_tokens": 348, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 132}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
