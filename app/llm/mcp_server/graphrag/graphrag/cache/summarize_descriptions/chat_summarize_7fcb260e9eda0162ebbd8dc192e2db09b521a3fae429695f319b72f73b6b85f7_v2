One of the critical manifestations is **scleroderma renal crisis**, a severe condition often accompanied by hypertension that requires immediate treatment with **ACE inhibitors (ACEIs)**.\n  \nDue to the disease's association with **Raynaud's phenomenon**, **beta-blockers should be avoided** in managing hypertension, as they may exacerbate vascular spasms. Systemic sclerosis not only poses a risk for renal complications but also contributes to **early cardiovascular morbidity**, emphasizing the need for careful monitoring and tailored therapeutic approaches.  \n\nThis summary integrates both descriptions, resolving potential contradictions by clarifying that hypertension in systemic sclerosis can arise from multiple mechanisms, including renal crisis and broader cardiovascular involvement, while highlighting the importance of appropriate medication choices.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559507, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 354, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 118}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
