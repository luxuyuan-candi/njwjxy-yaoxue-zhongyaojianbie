While **HBPM** involves periodic self-measurements at home, **ABPM** provides a more comprehensive assessment by recording blood pressure continuously over a 24-hour period, even during daily activities and sleep. Both methods are valuable for monitoring blood pressure in real-world conditions, offering insights that may not be captured in a single clinic visit.
