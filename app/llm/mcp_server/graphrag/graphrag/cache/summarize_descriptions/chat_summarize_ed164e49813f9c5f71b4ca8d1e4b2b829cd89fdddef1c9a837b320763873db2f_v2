Primarily derived from dried citrus peels, it is commonly employed to improve digestion and relieve phlegm, making it a staple in remedies for respiratory and gastrointestinal ailments. Additionally, 陈皮 (chén pí) is classified as a food-medicine substance, particularly effective in managing **qi stagnation and blood stasis-type hyperlipidemia**, where it aids in regulating lipid metabolism.  \n\nTo enhance its therapeutic effects and mitigate potential side effects, 陈皮 is often combined with other herbs, such as **胖大海 (pàng dà hǎi, Sterculia lychnophora)**, which helps reduce toxicity while maintaining efficacy. This synergistic use underscores its role in traditional formulations aimed at balancing herbal properties.  \n\nOverall, 陈皮 serves as both a functional food and a medicinal agent, valued for its digestive, respiratory, and metabolic benefits within traditional Chinese medicine practices. Its applications span standalone remedies and multi-herb formulations, reflecting its versatility and enduring significance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517895, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 212, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 394, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 118}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
