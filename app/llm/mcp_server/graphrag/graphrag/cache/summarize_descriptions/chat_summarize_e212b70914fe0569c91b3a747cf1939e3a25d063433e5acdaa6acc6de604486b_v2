It is a key metric in blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular health assessment. Diagnostic thresholds for hypertension vary depending on the measurement method: for **Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM)**, a threshold of **≥135 mmHg** is used, while **Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM)** relies on specific averaged values. SBP provides critical insights into cardiovascular function and is widely utilized in clinical and at-home settings to assess and manage hypertension.  \n\nThe two descriptions align in defining SBP as a vital measure of arterial pressure during systole (heart contraction) and emphasize its diagnostic importance. The first description adds context regarding hypertension thresholds, while the second clarifies its role in a standard blood pressure reading.
