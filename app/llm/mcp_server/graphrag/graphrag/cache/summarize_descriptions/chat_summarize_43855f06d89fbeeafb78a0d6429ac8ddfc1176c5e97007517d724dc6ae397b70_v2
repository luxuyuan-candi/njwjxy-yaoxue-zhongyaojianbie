It encompasses various conditions, often linked to hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperlipidemia (elevated cholesterol levels), and other risk factors such as poor dietary habits. These disorders are frequently associated with complications arising from uncontrolled hypertension, emphasizing the need for proactive risk assessment and management.  \n\nThe disease is influenced by multiple factors, including lifestyle choices like diet, as well as physiological conditions such as high cholesterol and sustained high blood pressure. Its prevalence and severity underscore the importance of early detection, preventive measures, and long-term management strategies to mitigate its impact. Collectively, cardiovascular disease represents a significant public health challenge, requiring comprehensive approaches to address its underlying causes and associated complications.  \n\nIn summary, cardiovascular disease involves a spectrum of heart and blood vessel disorders, driven by hypertension, cholesterol imbalances, and modifiable risk factors. Effective prevention and management are critical to reducing its global burden.
