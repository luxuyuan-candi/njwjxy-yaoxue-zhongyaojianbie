They often exhibit somatic symptoms—such as fatigue, pain, or gastrointestinal issues—rather than explicitly reporting emotional or psychological complaints, which can complicate diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, this demographic frequently manages multiple chronic conditions, including chronic congestive heart failure, dementia, late-stage cerebrovascular disease, or active malignancies. Due to their complex health profiles, certain interventions, such as lipid-lowering therapy, may be contraindicated or require careful consideration to avoid adverse effects.  \n\nThe summary integrates both descriptions, acknowledging that elderly patients may manifest illnesses differently while also highlighting specific conditions and treatment precautions relevant to this age group.
