Unlike primary hypertension, which has no single clear cause, secondary hypertension is attributable to specific disorders, such as renal disease (e.g., kidney dysfunction) or hormonal imbalances (e.g., hyperaldosteronism or Cushing's syndrome). This type of hypertension often requires thorough screening, particularly in cases where blood pressure remains resistant to standard treatments. Identifying and addressing the root cause—such as treating the underlying renal or endocrine disorder—is essential for effective management. Secondary hypertension underscores the importance of diagnostic evaluation in patients with persistent or unusually severe hypertension to rule out contributing medical conditions.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167052, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 144, "prompt_tokens": 188, "total_tokens": 332, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 124}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
