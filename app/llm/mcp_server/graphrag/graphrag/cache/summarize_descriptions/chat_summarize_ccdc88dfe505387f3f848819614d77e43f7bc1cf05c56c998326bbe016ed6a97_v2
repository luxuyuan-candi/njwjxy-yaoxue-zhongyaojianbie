Chronic elevation of cholesterol levels contributes to the development of CHD primarily through the process of atherosclerosis, where plaque builds up in the arteries, narrowing them and restricting blood flow to the heart. This accumulation of plaque increases the likelihood of cardiovascular complications, including heart attacks and other manifestations of CHD.  \n\nMultiple descriptions emphasize that high cholesterol is a major risk factor for CHD, underscoring its critical role in the disease's progression. The consistent association between high cholesterol and CHD highlights the importance of managing cholesterol levels through lifestyle changes, medication, or other interventions to reduce the risk of developing coronary heart disease.  \n\nIn summary, high cholesterol is a key contributor to coronary heart disease, primarily via atherosclerosis, and its management is essential in mitigating the risk of CHD-related complications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167720, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 190, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 395, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 141}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
