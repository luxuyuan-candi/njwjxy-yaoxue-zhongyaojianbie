This group includes medications such as **cholestyramine** (考来烯胺), **colestipol** (降胆宁), and **colesevelam**. These drugs function by binding to bile acids in the intestine, preventing their reabsorption into the bloodstream. By disrupting the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, bile acid sequestrants force the liver to utilize more cholesterol to produce new bile acids, thereby reducing circulating cholesterol levels.  \n\nBile acid sequestrants are commonly prescribed to manage hypercholesterolemia and are often used in conjunction with other lipid-lowering therapies. While effective, they may cause gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation or bloating. Their mechanism of action makes them particularly useful for patients who cannot tolerate statins or require additional cholesterol-lowering support.  \n\nThe descriptions provided consistently highlight the role of bile acid sequestrants in cholesterol management, emphasizing their binding action in the intestine and subsequent impact on lipid metabolism. No contradictions were found in the given data.
