Unlike other paragangliomas, HNPGLs are typically non-catecholamine-secreting tumors, meaning they do not produce catecholamines. As a result, they do not require preoperative α-receptor blockers, which are commonly used in the management of most pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs). This distinguishes HNPGLs from other PPGL cases that often necessitate such preoperative preparation. Overall, HNPGLs are characterized by their unique anatomical location and their lack of catecholamine production, influencing their clinical management.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559517, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 150, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 329, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 115}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
