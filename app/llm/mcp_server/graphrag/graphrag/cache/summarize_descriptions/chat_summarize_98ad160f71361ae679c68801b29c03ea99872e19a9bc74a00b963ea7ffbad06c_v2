These medications work by binding to bile acids in the intestine, preventing their reabsorption and promoting their excretion. This process forces the liver to use excess cholesterol to produce more bile acids, thereby reducing circulating cholesterol levels.  \n\nCommonly prescribed bile acid sequestrants include **cholestyramine**, **colestipol**, and **colesevelam**. These drugs are often utilized as part of lipid-lowering therapy, particularly for patients with hypercholesterolemia or those seeking adjunctive treatment alongside statins or lifestyle modifications. While effective, they may cause gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation or bloating.  \n\nBy targeting bile acid metabolism, bile acid sequestrants provide a non-systemic approach to cholesterol management, making them a valuable option in certain clinical scenarios. Their mechanism of action distinguishes them from other lipid-lowering agents, offering an alternative for patients who may not tolerate other therapies.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517974, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 203, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 403, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 136}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
