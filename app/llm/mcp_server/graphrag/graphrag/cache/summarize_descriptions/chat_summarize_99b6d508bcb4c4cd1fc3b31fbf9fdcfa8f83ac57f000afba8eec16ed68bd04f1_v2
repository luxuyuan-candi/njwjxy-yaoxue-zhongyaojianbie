It is a key focus for risk assessment and management in clinical practice, with an emphasis on early detection and intervention to mitigate adverse outcomes.  \n\nAtherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease is commonly managed through lipid-lowering therapies, such as statins, which help reduce cholesterol levels and slow plaque progression. These treatments are often part of a broader strategy that includes lifestyle modifications (e.g., diet, exercise) and control of other risk factors like hypertension and diabetes.  \n\nBy integrating risk assessment and targeted therapies, healthcare providers aim to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of ASCVD-related complications.
