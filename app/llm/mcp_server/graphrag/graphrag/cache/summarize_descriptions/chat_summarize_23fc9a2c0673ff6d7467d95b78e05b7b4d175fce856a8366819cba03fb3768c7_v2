The decline in estrogen levels during this stage contributes to an increased risk of cardiovascular conditions, particularly coronary heart disease. As a result, postmenopausal women are more susceptible to metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, necessitating closer monitoring of lipid profiles and preventive healthcare measures to mitigate these risks.  \n\nThis summary integrates both descriptions, highlighting the connection between hormonal changes, lipid metabolism, and cardiovascular health in postmenopausal women without contradiction.
