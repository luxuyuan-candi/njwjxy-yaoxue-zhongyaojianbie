It synthesizes cholesterol and triglycerides, contributing to lipid homeostasis, while also metabolizing lipids to maintain balance in the body. Additionally, the liver produces bile, a substance essential for digestion, and reabsorbs bile acids as part of a recycling process. This function requires cholesterol, which is utilized for the production of new bile acids.
