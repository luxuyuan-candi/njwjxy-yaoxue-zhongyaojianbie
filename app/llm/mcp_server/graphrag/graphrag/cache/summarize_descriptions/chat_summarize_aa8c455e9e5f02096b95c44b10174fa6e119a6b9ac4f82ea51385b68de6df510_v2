These inhibitors work by enhancing the liver's ability to remove LDL-C, primarily through increasing the number of LDL receptors on the liver's surface. They are commonly prescribed for patients who do not achieve their target LDL-C levels with statins and ezetimibe alone. PCSK9 inhibitors are often used in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies to optimize cholesterol management. Their mechanism of action involves binding to and inhibiting the PCSK9 protein, which promotes the degradation of LDL receptors, thereby allowing more receptors to remain active and clear LDL-C from the bloodstream.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559488, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 143, "prompt_tokens": 233, "total_tokens": 376, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 169}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
