They are effective in treating renal vascular hypertension when used as part of combination therapy. Additionally, they are indicated for hypertension cases complicated by conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), essential tremor, abnormal glucose or lipid metabolism, and refractory hypertension.  \n\nΑ受体阻滞剂 also play a critical role in the preoperative management of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), where they are routinely administered to prepare patients for surgery. Their versatility makes them suitable for both general hypertension treatment and specialized clinical situations, including BPH and metabolic disorders.  \n\nIn summary, Α受体阻滞剂 serve as a multifaceted therapeutic option, addressing hypertension in complex cases while also being essential in surgical preparations for PPGL.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559481, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 211, "total_tokens": 382, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 147}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
