As a leading authority, the CMA plays a pivotal role in developing and publishing clinical guidelines, consensus papers, and research to standardize and improve healthcare delivery across the country.  \n\nThe association addresses a wide range of medical disciplines, including acute upper respiratory tract infections, emergency hypertension diagnosis and treatment, dyslipidemias, and lipid management. For instance, it has published expert consensus on emergency hypertension and compiled guidelines for common diseases in primary healthcare institutions. Additionally, the CMA released the *Chinese Guidelines for Lipid Management (2023)* through its specialized branches, such as Cardiology, Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Laboratory Medicine, and earlier contributed to primary care guidelines for dyslipidemias in 2019.  \n\nBeyond clinical guidance, the CMA also tackles broader issues in medical publishing, such as duplicate submissions in journals, ensuring ethical standards in research dissemination. Its multifaceted involvement in guideline development, consensus-building, and professional oversight underscores its central role in shaping China's medical landscape.  \n\nIn summary, the **Chinese Medical Association** serves as a cornerstone of China's medical community, fostering evidence-based practice, research integrity, and standardized care through its extensive contributions to guidelines, consensus papers, and professional advocacy.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517874, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 268, "prompt_tokens": 363, "total_tokens": 631, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 299}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
