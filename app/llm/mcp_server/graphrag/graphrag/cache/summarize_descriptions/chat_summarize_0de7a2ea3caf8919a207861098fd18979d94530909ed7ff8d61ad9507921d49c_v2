Additionally, the ACR provides clinical guidelines for the management of gout, offering evidence-based recommendations to healthcare professionals for effective treatment and care.  \n\nBy combining its efforts in both classification and management, the ACR contributes to a more systematic approach to diagnosing and treating gout, ensuring better patient outcomes.
