It was included in the PROGRESS trial's Asian subgroup analysis, which focused on cardiovascular research. Additionally, Japan has been a site for hypertension research, including the HERB digital hypertension study, which explored innovative approaches to managing high blood pressure. In terms of mental health, Japan reported the lowest lifetime prevalence of depression (~3%) in the International Consortium of Psychiatric Epidemiology (ICPE) study, highlighting its unique epidemiological profile. These contributions underscore Japan's role in advancing global health research across both cardiovascular and mental health domains.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559393, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 121, "prompt_tokens": 183, "total_tokens": 304, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 119}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
