CKD is a significant risk factor for refractory hypertension and is strongly linked to nighttime hypertension prevalence.  \n\nManagement of CKD involves tailored treatment strategies based on age, severity, and comorbidities. For blood pressure control, combined antihypertensive therapy is frequently required, though there is a lack of comparative studies on optimal drug combinations for CKD patients. Additionally, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) may be considered when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is ≥20 mL/(min·1.73m²). Strict blood pressure control is especially important for long-term kidney protection in pediatric CKD patients.  \n\nCKD also poses risks in specific populations, such as pregnant individuals, where it increases the likelihood of preeclampsia. Overall, CKD is a multifaceted condition that necessitates comprehensive management to address its systemic effects and associated complications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559466, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 224, "prompt_tokens": 406, "total_tokens": 630, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 342}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
