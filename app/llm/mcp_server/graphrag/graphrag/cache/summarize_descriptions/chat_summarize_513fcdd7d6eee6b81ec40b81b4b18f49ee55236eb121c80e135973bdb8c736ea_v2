Cholesterol is utilized by the liver to produce bile acids, which aid in digestion and fat absorption. The liver plays a central role in cholesterol metabolism, regulating its synthesis, breakdown, and distribution throughout the body. Additionally, the liver metabolizes cholesterol and produces very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), a lipoprotein that transports triglycerides and cholesterol to other tissues. Together, these functions highlight the liver's critical involvement in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis and overall metabolic health.  \n\nThis summary integrates all provided descriptions, emphasizing the liver's multifaceted role in cholesterol processing without contradictions.
