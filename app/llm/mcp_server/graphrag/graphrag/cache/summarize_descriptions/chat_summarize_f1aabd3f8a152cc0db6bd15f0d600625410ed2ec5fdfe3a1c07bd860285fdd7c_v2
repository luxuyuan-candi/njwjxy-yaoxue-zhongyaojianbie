It is typically triggered by exposure to allergens such as pollen, dust mites, pet dander, or mold. Common symptoms include redness, itching, tearing, and swelling of the eyes. While the condition is generally not severe, it can cause significant discomfort and irritation for affected individuals.  \n\nThe condition is classified as minor because it rarely leads to serious complications or long-term vision problems. However, it may recur frequently in individuals with heightened sensitivity to allergens. Management often involves avoiding known allergens, using antihistamine eye drops, or taking oral medications to alleviate symptoms. In most cases, allergic conjunctivitis resolves with appropriate treatment and minimal intervention.  \n\nThis summary combines both descriptions, clarifying that while allergic conjunctivitis is a minor condition, it is still a notable medical issue caused by allergens and requiring appropriate care.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167017, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 204, "prompt_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 378, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 110}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
