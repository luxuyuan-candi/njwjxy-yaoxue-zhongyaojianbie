These deposits are often associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia and serve as a visible indicator of familial hyperlipidemia, a genetic condition marked by abnormally high levels of lipids in the blood. Xanthomas manifest as yellowish, firm nodules or plaques, typically found on areas such as the elbows, knees, hands, feet, or buttocks. Their presence often signals the need for further medical evaluation to diagnose and manage the underlying lipid disorder, which may include lifestyle modifications, medications, or other therapeutic interventions to reduce lipid levels and prevent complications.  \n\nThe condition underscores the link between systemic lipid abnormalities and cutaneous manifestations, emphasizing the importance of early detection and treatment to mitigate associated health risks.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167383, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 163, "prompt_tokens": 180, "total_tokens": 343, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 116}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
