It is known for its harmonizing properties, helping to balance and enhance the effects of other herbs in a prescription. By moderating the potency of different ingredients, 炙甘草 ensures a more balanced and effective formulation.  \n\nAs a prepared form of licorice root, it undergoes processing (such as honey-frying) to enhance its therapeutic benefits, particularly for tonifying qi and soothing the middle burner (spleen and stomach). Its dual role—both as a primary treatment for qi deficiency and as a harmonizing agent—makes it a versatile and widely used component in traditional Chinese medicine.  \n\nIn summary, 炙甘草 serves as both a therapeutic herb for digestive and energy-related deficiencies and a stabilizing ingredient that optimizes the efficacy of herbal combinations. Its applications reflect its importance in restoring balance and supporting overall health in TCM practices.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517908, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 220, "prompt_tokens": 170, "total_tokens": 390, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 106}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
