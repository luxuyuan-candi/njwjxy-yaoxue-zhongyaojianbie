It is frequently caused by oral hygiene issues, such as the buildup of bacteria on the teeth, tongue, or gums due to inadequate brushing, flossing, or rinsing. Poor oral care can lead to the accumulation of food particles and bacterial byproducts, which produce foul-smelling compounds.  \n\nIn addition to oral hygiene factors, halitosis may also stem from underlying medical conditions, such as gum disease, dry mouth (xerostomia), sinus infections, or digestive disorders. Effective management typically involves maintaining proper oral hygiene practices, including regular brushing, flossing, and the use of antimicrobial mouthwash. In cases where halitosis persists despite these measures, further evaluation by a dental or medical professional may be necessary to identify and address any contributing health issues.  \n\nThe provided descriptions align in defining halitosis as a condition marked by bad breath, primarily linked to oral bacteria and hygiene habits, with consistent recommendations for prevention and treatment.
