This function is essential for the breakdown of dietary fats and the regulation of lipid levels in the bloodstream. Deficiencies in LPL activity can lead to metabolic disorders, such as familial hypertriglyceridemia, characterized by elevated triglyceride levels and an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. The enzyme's activity is vital for maintaining energy homeostasis and ensuring proper lipid utilization in tissues.
