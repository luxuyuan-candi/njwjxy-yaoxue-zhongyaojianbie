Among its key functions, the adrenal cortex secretes **aldosterone**, a hormone released in response to stimulation by **angiotensin II**, which plays a vital role in regulating blood pressure and electrolyte balance. Additionally, the adrenal cortex produces other hormones, such as cortisol and androgens, which are involved in metabolism, immune response, and sexual development. Together, these functions highlight the adrenal cortex's central role in maintaining homeostasis through hormonal regulation.  \n\n(Word count: 99)", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167047, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 123, "prompt_tokens": 169, "total_tokens": 292, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 105}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
