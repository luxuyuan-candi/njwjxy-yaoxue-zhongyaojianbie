In children aged 3–15, it is classified as blood pressure ≥P95, and for those aged 16–17, the threshold is ≥140/90 mmHg. Hypertension is further categorized into grades 1, 2, and 3 based on severity.  \n\nThe condition can be **primary (essential)** or **secondary**, with secondary hypertension often linked to underlying disorders such as kidney disease (e.g., ADPKD, renal parenchymal disease), primary aldosteronism (especially in resistant cases or with hypokalemia), connective tissue diseases, or renal artery stenosis. It is strongly influenced by **genetic and environmental factors** and is frequently comorbid with **obesity, diabetes, high lipid levels, atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS)**.  \n\nHypertension is a **major risk factor** for cardiovascular diseases, including **stroke, coronary heart disease, acute coronary syndrome, acute left heart failure, aortic dissection, and cognitive impairment**. It also increases the risk of **target organ damage** (heart, brain, kidneys, blood vessels) and **retinal changes**. In diabetic patients, it exacerbates cardiovascular complications.  \n\n**Management** involves lifestyle modifications (e.g., the **DASH diet**, CHH, and spicy dietary interventions) and pharmacological treatments, including **MRAs (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists), CCBs (calcium channel blockers), ACEIs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers), ARNIs (angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors), and newer agents like aprocitentan for resistant cases**. Procedures such as **renal denervation (RDN)** may also be considered.  \n\nHypertension is a **central focus** of clinical guidelines (e.g., **JNC7, ESC**) and is extensively studied in **telemonitoring programs and clinical trials**. Its treatment intensity and timing depend on **blood pressure levels and cardiovascular risk stratification**, requiring tailored follow-up intervals.  \n\nIn summary, hypertension is a **multifactorial, chronic condition** with significant systemic implications, necessitating comprehensive prevention, monitoring, and management strategies to mitigate its widespread cardiovascular and organ-related complications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559409, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 481, "prompt_tokens": 1019, "total_tokens": 1500, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 955}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
