It is a diagnostic procedure used to assess key aspects of swallowing, including **penetration** (when food or liquid enters the airway but does not pass below the vocal folds), **aspiration** (when material enters the airway below the vocal folds), and **residue** (remaining material in the pharynx after swallowing). While the VFSS is a critical tool for assessing swallowing disorders in general, it is particularly emphasized as the gold standard for evaluating swallowing function in **stroke patients**, who often experience dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) as a result of neurological impairment. The procedure utilizes real-time X-ray imaging (fluoroscopy) to visualize the swallowing mechanism, providing clinicians with detailed insights to guide treatment and management strategies.  \n\nBy combining these descriptions, it is clear that the VFSS serves as the most reliable method for diagnosing swallowing impairments across various patient populations, with a strong emphasis on its role in stroke-related dysphagia assessment. The summary remains consistent, as both descriptions reinforce the VFSS's status as the gold standard while highlighting its broader applicability alongside its specific importance for stroke patients.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167575, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 249, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 438, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 125}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
