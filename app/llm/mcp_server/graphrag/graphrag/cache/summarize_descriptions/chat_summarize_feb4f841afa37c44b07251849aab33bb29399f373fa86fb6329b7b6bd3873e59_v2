The harmful effects of smoking on cardiovascular health are multifaceted, primarily damaging blood vessels and accelerating the process of atherosclerosisâ€”the buildup of fatty plaques in arterial walls. This narrowing and hardening of the arteries restrict blood flow to the heart, elevating the risk of CHD. Multiple sources consistently identify smoking as a key contributor to CHD, underscoring its role in worsening cardiovascular outcomes. By impairing vascular function and promoting inflammatory processes, smoking exacerbates the conditions that lead to coronary heart disease. Thus, avoiding smoking is critical in reducing the risk of CHD and maintaining heart health.  \n\n*(Word count: 120)*", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167748, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 350, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 61}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
