His work involves the study and application of knee-controlled orthoses (膝控制性矫形器) to address mobility challenges in stroke survivors. Specifically, he has investigated how these orthoses contribute to the rehabilitation of lower limb motor function, as well as their effects on knee stability and the mitigation of foot inversion in patients.  \n\nBy examining both functional recovery and biomechanical outcomes, his research highlights the potential of knee-controlled orthoses as a therapeutic tool for improving mobility and stability in stroke patients. This dual focus suggests a comprehensive approach to rehabilitation, targeting not only movement restoration but also the prevention of secondary complications such as joint instability or abnormal gait patterns.  \n\nWhile the descriptions emphasize slightly different aspects of his work—motor function rehabilitation versus knee and foot stability—they are complementary rather than contradictory. Together, they demonstrate his broader interest in optimizing orthotic interventions to enhance post-stroke recovery.  \n\nIn summary, 王建晖's research contributes to the field of neurorehabilitation by exploring the efficacy of knee-controlled orthoses in improving lower limb function, stability, and overall mobility in stroke patients.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752166949, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 244, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 437, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 0, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 193}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
