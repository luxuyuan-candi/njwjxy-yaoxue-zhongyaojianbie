This condition is a severe and potentially life-threatening type of stroke, as the accumulated blood can increase pressure on the brain, causing damage to surrounding areas and impairing vital functions. It is closely linked to cardiovascular health, often arising from conditions such as hypertension (high blood pressure), aneurysms, or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which weaken blood vessel walls over time.  \n\nThe rupture of these vessels disrupts normal blood flow and oxygen supply to the brain, resulting in rapid neurological deterioration. Symptoms may include sudden severe headache, weakness or numbness in the face or limbs, difficulty speaking, loss of coordination, or altered consciousness. Immediate medical intervention is critical to minimize brain damage and improve survival outcomes.  \n\nAs a subtype of stroke, cerebral hemorrhage underscores the importance of managing cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption, to reduce the likelihood of such events. Treatment may involve surgical intervention, medication to control bleeding and pressure, and long-term rehabilitation to address neurological deficits.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167417, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 243, "prompt_tokens": 181, "total_tokens": 424, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 128}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 128, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 53}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
