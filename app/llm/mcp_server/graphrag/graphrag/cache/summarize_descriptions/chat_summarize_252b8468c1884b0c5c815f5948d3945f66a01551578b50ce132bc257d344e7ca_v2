The dish is prepared with specific proportions: 10g of black rice, 60g of brown rice, 10g of millet, and 10g of sorghum. Some variations may also incorporate barley, though the primary recipe emphasizes the four core grains.  \n\nThis mixed grain rice is valued for its health benefits, as it combines the fiber-rich and nutrient-dense properties of each grain. Black rice contributes antioxidants, brown rice provides essential minerals, millet offers a light texture, and sorghum adds a slightly nutty flavor. The dish is a wholesome alternative to plain white rice, often chosen for its balanced nutritional profile and satisfying texture.  \n\nServed as a lunch item, 杂粮米饭 is a staple in health-conscious diets, offering a hearty and flavorful meal while promoting better digestion and sustained energy.
