It is a primary focus of lipid management guidelines, which aim to control cholesterol levels and other risk factors to mitigate disease progression.  \n\nASCVD is preventable through lifestyle modifications, with complete smoking cessation and effective avoidance of secondhand smoke being key preventive measures. These actions significantly reduce the risk of developing the disease. As a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality, ASCVD underscores the importance of early intervention, risk factor management, and public health initiatives to promote heart-healthy behaviors.  \n\nThis summary integrates medical, preventive, and public health perspectives to present a unified understanding of ASCVD, emphasizing both clinical management and lifestyle-based prevention strategies.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517924, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 191, "prompt_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 395, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 140}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
