It is primarily used to treat conditions such as cold limbs and yang deficiency, which are associated with poor circulation and a lack of bodily warmth in TCM theory. Additionally, 细辛 is a key component in the formulation of **乌梅丸** (Wu Mei Wan), a classical TCM prescription often employed for disorders like parasitic infections or digestive imbalances.  \n\nWhen preparing 细辛 for medicinal use, it is recommended to decoct (boil) the herb first (\"先煎\") to ensure proper extraction of its active compounds. The typical dosage ranges from **3 to 6 grams**, adhering to TCM safety guidelines to avoid potential toxicity.  \n\nThis summary integrates both traditional uses and preparation methods, presenting a coherent overview of 细辛's role in Chinese herbal medicine.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752167155, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 179, "prompt_tokens": 177, "total_tokens": 356, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 113}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
