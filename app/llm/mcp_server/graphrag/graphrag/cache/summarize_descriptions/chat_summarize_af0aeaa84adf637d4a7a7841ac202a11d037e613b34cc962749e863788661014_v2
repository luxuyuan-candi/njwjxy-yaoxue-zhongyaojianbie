The journal publishes high-quality scientific articles, including studies that investigate clinical and biomechanical aspects of human movement. For example, **GAIT POSTURE** has featured research on the impact of various ankle-foot orthosis designs on gait patterns in stroke patients, highlighting its relevance to both clinical practice and rehabilitation. By bridging theoretical and applied research, the journal serves as a key resource for professionals and researchers in biomechanics, neurology, physical therapy, and related disciplines. Its contributions advance the understanding of movement disorders and therapeutic interventions, fostering innovation in patient care.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1752166949, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 318, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 0, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 178}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
