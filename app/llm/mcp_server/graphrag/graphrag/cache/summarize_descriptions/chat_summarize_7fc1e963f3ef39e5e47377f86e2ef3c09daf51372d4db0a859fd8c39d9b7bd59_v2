CKD, especially in stages 3-4, directly qualifies patients as high-risk for ASCVD due to its systemic effects on vascular and metabolic health. This elevated risk profile influences clinical decision-making, particularly in the selection and dosing of lipid-lowering therapies. Healthcare providers must carefully consider CKD when managing ASCVD risk, as the disease's progression and associated complications necessitate tailored treatment strategies to optimize patient outcomes.  \n\nIn summary, CKD is a key determinant of ASCVD risk, with advanced stages (3-4) categorizing patients as high-risk.
