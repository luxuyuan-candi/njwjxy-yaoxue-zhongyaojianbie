This assessment tool categorizes the severity of a child's fever into distinct levels, aiding healthcare providers in determining appropriate interventions. It serves as a standardized method for identifying potential red flags and ensuring timely medical care for pediatric patients. The system is widely recognized for its practical application in clinical settings, combining both international terminology (e.g., \"traffic light system\") and its formal Chinese designation.
