Recognized as a medicinal and edible substance, it holds significant value in promoting health and treating specific conditions. In traditional Chinese medicine, lotus seeds are particularly noted for their efficacy in addressing **high lipidemia (hyperlipidemia)** of certain types, including **phlegm-dampness obstruction (痰浊内阻型)**, **qi deficiency and blood stasis (气虚血瘀型)**, and **spleen deficiency with dampness excess (脾虚湿盛型)**.  \n\nAs a food, lotus seeds are commonly incorporated into soups, desserts, and herbal dishes for their mild, slightly sweet flavor and nutritional benefits. Rich in protein, fiber, and essential minerals, they contribute to overall wellness while serving therapeutic purposes. Their dual role as both a functional food and a medicinal herb underscores their importance in Chinese dietary therapy and holistic health practices.  \n\nIn summary, **莲子** is a valuable **食药物质 (medicinal food)** with applications in managing lipid metabolism disorders and enhancing general health through dietary and medicinal use. Its integration into traditional remedies and cuisine highlights its enduring cultural and therapeutic significance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753517932, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 246, "prompt_tokens": 179, "total_tokens": 425, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 115}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
