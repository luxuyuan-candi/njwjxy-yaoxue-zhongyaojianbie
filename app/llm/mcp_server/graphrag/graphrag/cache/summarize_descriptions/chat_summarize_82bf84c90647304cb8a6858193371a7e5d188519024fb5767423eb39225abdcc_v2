They include medications such as sertraline, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, reboxetine, phencyclidine, and phenelzine, which primarily function by modulating serotonin levels in the brain. However, some antidepressants are also noted for their potential to elevate blood pressure, as they can increase myocardial and vascular sensitivity to sympathetic stimulation. While their therapeutic effects are well-documented, their cardiovascular side effects, including blood pressure changes, warrant careful monitoring during treatment.  \n\nThis summary integrates all provided descriptions, acknowledging both the pharmacological mechanisms and the potential risks associated with antidepressant use.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1751559509, "model": "deepseek-chat", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": "fp_8802369eaa_prod0623_fp8_kvcache", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 142, "prompt_tokens": 193, "total_tokens": 335, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 64}, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 64, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 129}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
