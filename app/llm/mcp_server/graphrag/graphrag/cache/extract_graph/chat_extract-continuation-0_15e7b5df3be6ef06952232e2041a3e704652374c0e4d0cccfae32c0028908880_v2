压<130mmHg的治疗目标能够实现有效性和安全  性之间的最佳平衡[143] 。\n\n\n　　　以往研究结果提示 ,老年高血压患者较一般高血 压患者的血压目标更高 ,但 2021年的一项临床研究和 亚组分析显示[77,142]  ,更低的诊室血压目标(收缩压< 130mmHg) 可能对老年人群有益 。但应注意 ,年龄增 高并不是设定更高降压目标的充分条件 ,对于老年患 者 ,应根据患者合并症的严重程度 ,对治疗的耐受性及 影响坚持治疗的因素进行全面评估 ,综合考虑决定患 者的降压目标。\n　　　综 上 所 述 , 关 于 诊 室 血 压 的 目 标 值 建 议 如 下  (图 4) :①心血管风险高危/很高危的高血压患者以及  有合并症的高血压患者 ,在可耐受的条件下 ,推荐诊室  血压目标为<130/80mmHg。②无合并症的一般高  血压患者 ,推荐降至<140/90mmHg,如能耐受 ,应进  一步降至<130/80mmHg。③老年高血压患者 ,65~  79岁老年人推荐降压目标<140/90mmHg,如能耐  受 ,可降至<130/80mmHg;80岁及以上高龄老年人  降压目标<150/90mmHg,如能耐受 ,可降至<140/ 90mmHg。\n　　治疗方案的选择和应用的强度应权衡长期获益和  患者耐受性 ,应考虑强化降压治疗可能导致的低血压、 电解质异常、急性肾损伤或衰竭以及晕厥等严重不良  事件[77]  ,应避免或减少由于患者不耐受所导致的停  药 。对高危和很高危患者采取强化干预措施 ,对无严  重合并症但已有亚临床靶器官损害的患者采取积极干  预措施逆转靶器官损害有一定合理性 ,低中危的正常  高值血压人群给予降压药治疗无临床获益。\n　　　虽然也有一些证据提示在一些特殊人群中更高或 更低的血压目标 ,但这主要取决于患者对治疗的耐受 性和治疗的复杂程度 。如果不需采用复杂的治疗方案 即可将血压降至更低的水平且患者可以耐受 ,并不需 要改变治疗方案而使降低的血压回升。\n\n\n　　　　　　\n图 4  诊室血压目标\n\n\n5.1.3.2  诊室血压以外的降压治疗目标    明确血压 目标值对于做好高血压管理具有重要意义
