硬化脂蛋白”，其不足可以说明清除动脉壁中胆固醇的能力较差， 所以也易发生动脉粥样硬化。\n　　　因此，高脂血症与冠心病的关系非常密切，血脂升高伴随着发 生冠心病的危险增加，降低血脂也能降低冠心病的发生率。\n摇摇苑援高脂血症的“危险伙伴”之六———脑卒中\n　　　当血液中胆固醇增高时，容易形成动脉硬化斑块，这些斑块在 动脉壁内堆积，使动脉管腔狭窄，阻塞血液流入相应部位，当它发 生在脑血管时引起脑梗死。医学证明：长期降脂治疗不仅能治疗 脑梗死，还能预防脑梗死。\n　　脑卒中的原因很多，有高血压、高脂血症、吸烟、饮酒、肥胖、高 龄、糖尿病、血液病等，其中高脂血症、脑动脉粥样硬化是脑梗死的 重要危险因素之一。许多研究证明，长期降脂治疗能明显减低脑 卒中的发生率和致残率。因此，临床医生对高脂血症的治疗越来 越重视。\n

和高胆固醇饮食会诱发动脉粥样硬化，在一部分有遗传性脂质代 谢缺陷的人中表现比较明显，这些人由于难以清除血循环中过多 的中性脂肪和胆固醇，或者体内产生过多，而引起血液中胆固醇和 三酰甘油浓度升高。\n　　　近年来对饮食脂肪与动脉硬化的关系又有新的认识。北美洲 阿拉斯加的爱斯基摩人喜欢大量食用海洋生物，例如海贝、牡蛎和 鱼子酱，尽管摄入大量脂肪饮食，但他们动脉硬化的发生率较低。
