inhibitor，RASI），尤其是长效 制剂。部分利尿剂与β受体阻滞剂可影响脂代谢，不  同程度地造成血脂水平的改变，因此，对于高血压合  并血脂异常的患者，宜小剂量用药。各类降压药物均  可与他汀类药物联合使用。随机对照试验（randomized  controlled trial，RCT） 研究证实［9］，降压联合调脂  治疗是高血压患者预防和治疗 ASCVD 的关键所在。 ASCOT LLA 研究结果提示［31］，较早启动他汀调脂治 疗的高血压患者全因死亡风险可下降 14%。\n\n\n\n\n6        \n\n\n中国合理用药探索\n\n\nCHINESE JOURNAL OF RATIONAL DRUG USE\n\n\n标准与讨论 \n\n\n\n4.3.2 降压药物与调脂药物相互影响\n　　（1）降压药物对血脂的影响：在基层医疗实践 中，应避免使用可影响血脂的抗高血压药，CCB、 ACEI、ARB 类降压药对血脂影响较小。CCB 不 仅可有效降压，还具有直接的抗动脉粥样硬化的作  用。有学者认为［32］，CCB 的抗动脉硬化作用与其 减少胆固醇在血管壁上的沉着有关。高脂溶性他汀  类药物如辛伐他汀、洛伐他汀在体内主要依赖细胞  色素 P450 酶中的 CYP3A4 代谢，氨氯地平能够抑 制 CYP3A4 而减慢这 2 种他汀类药的代谢，导致  血药浓度升高，增加肌病的发生风险。因此，氨氯  地平与辛伐他汀、洛伐他汀合用时两药的剂量均应  ≤20mg/d。硝苯地平控释片、非洛地平缓释片对  CYP3A4 的抑制作用相对更弱，与他汀类药的药物 相互作用不明显。目前，单片复方制剂（single-pill combination，SPC） 相对安全。临床常用的 ACEI 尚无与其他药物在代谢方面发生具有重要临床相互 作用的报道。替米沙坦、缬沙坦、奥美沙坦酯不经  细胞色素 P450 酶代谢。厄贝沙坦主要由细胞色素  P450 酶 CYP2C9 氧化。上述 ARB 类降压药联合他 汀类药使用会有药动学影响［33］。高选择性β1 受体 阻滞剂对脂质代谢几乎没有不良影响。\n　　（2）调脂治疗对高血压患者的影响：基层医疗 实践中，联合降压、调血脂治疗时可选用具有降压 作用的调血脂药物，如他汀类药物、中成药（血脂 康）、胆固醇吸收抑制剂以及同时具有降压和降胆固 醇作用的 SPC［14］。强化调脂治疗不仅可以改善动 脉的顺应性，还可以有效降低动脉压［35］。他汀类 调脂\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RENIN ANGIOTENSIN
