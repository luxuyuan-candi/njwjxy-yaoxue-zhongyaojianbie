min的相关康复训练，能够提高患者的功能目标，在一定范围内，相对增加训练强度可提高训练效果，但要考虑患者的安全性。住院康复机构在患者能耐受的情况下，开展每天3 h、每周5 d的康复训练是可行的，包括物理治疗、作业疗法、言语训练以及必要的康复护理[9]。\n　　推荐意见：(1)脑卒中患者病情稳定(生命体征稳定，症状体征不再进展)后应尽早介入康复治疗(Ⅰ级推荐，A级证据)。(2)脑卒中轻到中度的患者，在发病24 h后可以进行床边康复、早期离床期的康复训练，康复训练应以循序渐进的方式进行，必要时在监护条件下进行(Ⅰ级推荐，A级证据)。(3)康复训练强度要考虑到患者的体力、耐力和心肺功能情况，在条件许可的情况下，开始阶段每天至少45 min的康复训练，能够改善患者的功能，适当增加训练强度是有益的(Ⅱ级推荐，B级证据)。\n脑卒中早期良肢位摆放、体位转移和关节活动度训练\n　　脑卒中急性期卧床患者的良肢位摆放、床上体位转移技术、关节活动度训练技术，是脑卒中康复护理的基础和早期康复介入的重要方面，早期良好的肢位摆放和适当的关节活动度训练，能够减少并发症、提高护理质量、加快卒中患者的康复速度[7]。有充分的证据证明，卒中后长期卧床不活动会严重影响患者的神经肌肉功能、心血管功能、呼吸功能和免疫功能；卒中后制动相关的并发症如深静脉血栓、关节挛缩等亦明显增多；此外，长期不运动也会影响患者功能恢复潜力，特别是平衡功能的恢复，降低大脑的可塑性和功能重组[10]。\n　　良肢位摆放是利用各种软性靠垫将患者置于舒适的抗痉挛体位，正确的体位摆放应该贯穿在偏瘫后的各个时期，注意定时改变体位，一般每2小时体位转换1次。鼓励患侧卧位，该体位增加了患肢的感觉刺激，并使整个患侧被拉长，从而减少痉挛，且健手能自由活动；适当健侧卧位；应尽量避免半卧位，因半坐卧位能引起对称性颈紧张性反射，增加肢体上肢屈曲、下肢伸直的异常痉挛模式；尽可能少采用仰卧位，因为这种体位受颈紧张性反射和迷路反射的影响，会加重异常运动模式和引发骶尾部、足跟和外踝处褥疮的发生，可仅作为一种替换体位或者患者需要这种体位时采用；保持正确的坐姿，与卧床相比，坐位有利于躯干的伸展，可以达到促进全身身体及精�\n######################\nOutput:",
