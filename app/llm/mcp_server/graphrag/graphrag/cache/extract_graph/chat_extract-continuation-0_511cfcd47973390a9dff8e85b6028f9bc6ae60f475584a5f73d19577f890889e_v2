精神紧张是我国人群重要的高血压发病危险因素， 其中高钠、低钾膳食以及超重与高血压关系最  大2.4,另外其他危险因素还包括年龄、高血压家族  史、缺乏体力活动以及糖尿病、血脂异常等。\n　　调查发现2012年我国18岁及以上居民平均烹 调盐日摄入量为10.5g?,   虽低于1992年的12.9 g 和2002年的12.0g, 但较推荐盐摄入量水平依旧高 75.0%。\n　　近年来，我国人群中超重和肥胖比例明显增 加，35~64岁中年人超重率为38.8%,肥胖率为 20.2%,超重组和肥胖组高血压发病风险是体重正 常组的1.16~1.28倍4。超重和肥胖与高血压患病 率关联最显著2。\n三、病理生理机制[6-7】\n　　高血压的发病机制复杂，血压的调节受心输出 量和外周阻力的影响以及很多解剖、生理、生化方面 的因素影响，基本的血液动力学特征表现见图1。\n(一)遗传的影响\n高血压具有家族聚集性，估计遗传因素对血压\n\n·302·                                                                                                                          中华全科医师杂志2019年4月第18卷第4期Chin J Gen Pract,April 2019,Vol.18.No.4\n\n\n的变异影响占30%~50%8,但血压终究是一种表 型，是环境与多种遗传基因表达的相互作用的结 果。目前有关基因多态性与血压的关联性的候选 基因多直接或间接与控制肾脏钠的重吸收有关，如 调控肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统(RAAS) 的 基 因、α-内收蛋白基因等。\n(二)心输出量\n　　心输出量增加主要是在高血压发病的初始阶 段，此阶段的心率增加也是高动力循环的表现，促 进心输出量增加；其次是通过促进心输出量增加而 致循环血量增加。一旦高血压呈持续状态，机体的 自动调节机制使心输出量不再增高或恢复至正常 状态，同时促进外周阻力增高，为血压持续升高阶 段的主要影响因素。\n(三)钠摄入的影响\n　　钠摄入增多引起血压增高的主要机制是增加 心脏前负荷，促进心输出量增加。高钠摄入可激活 加压机制，包括细胞内钙增加、胰岛素抵抗、心房利 钠肽的矛盾升高，血管紧张素I 型受体上调。钠敏 感性增高人群中高血压患病率明显增高。\n(四)水钠潴留\n　　实验研究证明，高血压发生过程中的肾脏本身 的排钠异常起到重要作用。高血压人群中存在肾 单位异质性，存在排钠降低的肾单位和已适应高滤 过、高利尿钠的肾单位；肾素在前者分泌增高，在后 者\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>HIGH SODIUM, LOW POTASSIUM DIET<|>EVENT<|>High
