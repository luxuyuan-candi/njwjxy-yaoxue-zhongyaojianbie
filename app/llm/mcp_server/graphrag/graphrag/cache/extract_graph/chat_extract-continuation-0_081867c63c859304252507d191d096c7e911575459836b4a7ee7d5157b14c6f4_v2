体的诊疗建议。因此，在采取任何行动之前，必须 考虑自身理解能力或咨询医疗专业人员。\n\n\n第二部分  常见轻微病症的概述\n\n\n一、常见轻微病症的定义\n　　　　“ 常 见 轻 微 病 症 ” 一 词 源 自 英 文 \"minor  ailment”,直译为“小病”“微恙”,是指一组发病率  高、症状轻微、通常无需复杂治疗或专业医疗干预、 病程持续时间较短的健康问题。这些疾病或症状 通常可以通过自我护理或简单的OTC治疗而好转， 例如普通感冒、头痛、足癣等。英国、加拿大、澳大  利亚等国家，以及中国香港等地区针对常见轻微病 症的相关定义虽略有差异，但普遍遵循上述 原则[3-4,6。\n　　　　　国内既往虽无明确规范定义，但长久以来，公 众已经对这类疾病或症状有一定认同，例如“小毛 病”或“头疼脑热”即代表这类健康问题。通过文献\n\n\n复习检索和专家讨论修订，将常见轻微病症定义 为：症状持续时间短、呈自限性、无需或只需短期随 访、可通过最低限度治疗即可缓解的症状或疾病。\n二、流行病学资料\n　　　　　英国一项研究显示，常见轻微病症在门急诊总 就诊量中占比很高，在全科预约门诊中，约有22.3%  的就诊属于轻微病症，13.2%可以在社区药店有效  治疗而无需就医。门诊最常见的轻微病症是上呼吸  道感染(44.6%),其次是肌肉骨骼疼痛(26.2%)和皮  肤问题(10.2%)。在急诊中，也约有6.0%的就诊属  于轻微病症，5.3%可以在社区药店管理而无需急诊  就医，急诊最常见的轻微病症是肌肉骨骼疼痛  (75.9%)[2]。加拿大的研究也显示出常见轻微病症  的高发病率， 一项针对1202名加拿大居民的调查  列出了9种常见的轻微症状或疾病：普通感冒[或流  行性感冒(简称流感)]、头痛、肌肉疼痛、皮肤干燥、 便秘、胃灼热、背痛、过敏和失眠。96.5%的受访者  至少经历了其中1种症状，平均经历了3.6种不同症  状。在另一项加拿大全国性调查中，居民6个月内 最常见的疾病包括感冒(41%)、头痛或偏头痛  (34%)、肌肉疼痛(34%)和胃部不适(22%)?。\n　　　　　常见轻微病症带来了较重的医疗负担，而通过  社区�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRITISH STUDY<|>EVENT<|>A study
