MSU 晶体 。如果第一步不可行，第二步通过临床诊 断（建立在存在高尿酸血症和痛风相关临床特征的 基础上），满足下列特征时考虑临床诊断（高度怀疑 但非特异性表现）：足部（特别是第一跖趾关节）或 踝关节单关节受累，之前类似的急性关节炎发作 史 ，关节快速开始的剧烈疼痛和肿胀（24 h 内达 峰），皮肤发红，男性并存在相关的心血管疾病和高 尿酸血症 。第三步，当痛风的临床诊断不确定且不 能证实 MSU 晶体时，建议寻找晶体沉积的影像学 证据，特别是超声或双能 CT。\n美国风湿病学会 1977 年制订的痛风分类标\n\n\n\n中华内科杂志 2023 年 9 月第 62 卷第 9 期    Chin J Intern Med, September 2023, Vol.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
