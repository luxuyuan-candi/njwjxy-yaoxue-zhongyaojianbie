下 , 如 血 液 透 析 的 患 者 , 建 议 进 行  44 ~ 48  h ABPM[436] 。\n　　　近年来 ,一些新型家用上臂式电子血压计及新型 腕式血压计也可用于家庭夜间血压评估 ,用于筛查夜 间高血压及对患者进行长期随访[434] 。\n　6.4.3  靶器官损害及心血管预后    夜间血压升高与 正常血压人群、高血压、糖尿病及 CKD患者无症状靶 器官损害如 PWV增快、颈动脉 IMT增加、心肌肥厚 等以及心、肾事件风险增加密切相关 。夜间高血压患 者比夜间血压正常者更有可能发生心脏和颈动脉结构 变化[437] 。两项大型研究表明 ,单纯夜间高血压与更 高的靶器官损害和不良结局风险相关[437-438] 。在多项 研究和荟萃分析中 ,夜间血压被证实对不良结局(包括 心血管事件和死亡) 的预测能力比白天血压[439] 甚至 24h血压更强[58]

年高血压患者等尤应注意。\n　　　改善夜间高血压的方法包括 : ①积极治疗原发疾  病及伴发的临床疾病 ,如原发性醛固酮增多症、糖尿  病、CKD、阻 塞 性 睡 眠 呼 吸 暂 停 综 合 征 (obstructive sleep apneasyndrome,OSAS)等 ;②生活方式干预 ,如  低钠富钾膳食、改善睡眠、减重等 ,有助于夜间血压控  制 ;③推荐长效降压药足量使用或两种及多种药物联  合 ;④在可及前提下 ,优先采用具有控制夜间血压优势  的降压药 ;⑤睡前服药能否更有效控制夜间高血压还  需要进一步研究。\n6.5   单纯收缩期高血压(ISH)\n\n要点 6E   单纯收缩期高血压(ISH)\n　　　· 推 荐 老 年  ISH  目 标 收 缩 压 为  140 ~ 150mmHg( Ⅰ , A) , 如 耐 受 性 良
