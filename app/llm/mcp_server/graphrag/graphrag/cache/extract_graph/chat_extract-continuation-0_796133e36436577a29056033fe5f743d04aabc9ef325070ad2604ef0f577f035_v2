血 压  (<135/85mmHg) 和夜间血压(<120/70mmHg) 均  正常 ,或 7 d连续监测的家庭血压平均值正常(<135/ 85mmHg) ,可诊断为白大衣性高血压 。对于已经降  压治疗的患者 ,表现为上述血压特征的 ,则称为白大衣  性未控制高血压[80,92] 。\nABPM 和 HBPM 都可以用来诊断白大衣性高血\n\n\n\n　压 ,但二者可能存在诊断不一致的情况 。动态和家庭  血压均正常的白大衣性高血压 ,其心血管风险较单一  诊室外血压正常者更低[408] 。 因此 ,对家庭血压正常  的白大衣性高血压 ,在有条件的情况下最好进一步用  ABPM进行确诊[409] 。使用 ABPM 诊断时 ,用严格的  24h+白天 +夜间各个时段血压均正常来诊断更合  适 。24h各个时段血压均正常的白大衣性高血压和  正常血压相比
