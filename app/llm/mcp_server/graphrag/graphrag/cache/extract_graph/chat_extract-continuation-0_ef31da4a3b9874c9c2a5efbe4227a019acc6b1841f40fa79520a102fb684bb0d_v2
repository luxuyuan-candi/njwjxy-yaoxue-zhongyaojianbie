�患者制定交流障碍的代偿方法，以及教育患者周围的人们，促使其与患者积极交流、减少对患者的孤立、满足患者的愿望和需求。早期可针对患者听、说、读、写、复述等障碍给予相应的简单指令训练、口颜面肌肉发音模仿训练、复述训练，口语理解严重障碍的患者可以试用文字阅读、书写或交流板进行交流[22]。一项随机对照试验研究证实，高强度的治疗比低强度的治疗更有效[23]。\n　　推荐意见：(1)建议由言语治疗师对存在交流障碍的卒中患者从听、说、读、写、复述等几个方面进行评价，针对性的对语音和语义障碍进行治疗(Ⅱ级推荐，C级证据)。(2)建议卒中后交流障碍的患者早期开始语言功能障碍的康复，适当增加语言康复训练强度是有效的(Ⅰ级推荐，A级证据)。(3)卒中早期可针对患者听、说、读、写、复述等障碍给予相应的简单指令训练、口颜面肌肉发音模仿训练、复述训练，口语理解严重障碍的患者可以试用文字阅读、书写或交流板进行交流(Ⅱ级推荐，B级证据)。\n脑卒中后认知障碍的康复\n　　针对脑卒中后认知障碍，可应用简易精神状态检查(MMSE)、蒙特利尔认知评估量表(MoCA)进行筛查[24,25]。进一步认知功能检查和康复，可待急性期过后进行认知障碍详细的评测和针对性的康复。卒中后早期偏侧忽略明显影响康复的预后，早期发现和干预偏侧忽略能有效促进卒中患者的功能恢复[26]。\n　　推荐意见：(1)脑卒中后认知障碍，可应用MMSE、MoCA进行筛查，并评估其对康复和护理的影响(Ⅱ级推荐，B级证据)。(2)脑卒中后进一步认知功能检查和康复，可待急性期过后进行认知障碍详细的评测和针对性的康复，早期发现和干预偏侧忽略是卒中后认知康复重要部分(Ⅱ级推荐，B级证据)。\n脑卒中后吞咽障碍的康复和营养管理\n　　吞咽障碍是脑卒中患者的常见症状，发生率为22%～65%，常对患者的生理、心理健康造成严重影响。在生理方面，吞咽功能减退可造成误吸、支气管痉挛、气道阻塞窒息以及脱水、营养不良，卒中后误吸与进展为肺炎的高危险性有关[27]。饮水试验是较常用的临床筛查方法，文献报道，饮水试验预测误吸的敏感度>70 %，特异度22%～66%[28]。视频X线透视吞咽检查(VFSS)是评价吞咽功能的\"金标准\"，纤维内窥镜吞咽功能检查(FEES)也是吞咽功能检查的重要客观手段，能直观地看到吞咽过程中咽\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
