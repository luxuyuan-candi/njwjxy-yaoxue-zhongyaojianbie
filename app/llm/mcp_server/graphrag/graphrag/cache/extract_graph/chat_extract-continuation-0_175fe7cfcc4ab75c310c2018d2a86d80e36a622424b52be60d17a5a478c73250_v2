继发性高脂血症。原发性高脂血症是指脂质和脂蛋白代谢先天性\n◆                                                                                                  摇摇\n\n\t 高脂血症防治      \n缺陷（家族性）以及某些环境因素通过各种机制所引起的。这些 环境因素包括饮食和药物等，现概述如下：\n　　（员）遗传因素摇遗传可通过多种机制引起高脂血症，某些可 能发生在细胞水平上，主要表现为细胞表面脂蛋白受体缺陷以及 细胞内某些酶的缺陷（如脂蛋白酯酶的缺陷或缺乏），也可发生在 脂蛋白或载脂蛋白的分子上，多由于基因缺陷引起。\n　　据报道，Ⅰ  ~ Ⅴ型高脂血症都可以发生遗传，但国内临床上最 常遇到的是 Ⅱ 型，即家族性高胆固醇血症。仅上海地区就已发现 了十多个家族的几十位病人。复旦大学中山医院曾对 员例家族性 高胆固醇血症的死亡病例进行尸体解剖，发现病人主动脉内膜表 面到处是粥样斑块，就如同涂上一层厚厚的奶油蛋糕，在病人的心 脏中也发现有多处心肌梗死的“遗迹”。有资料报道，国外有这样 的病人 猿岁就死于心肌梗死。这些病例有不少见于近亲结婚者， 非近亲结婚可有效地遏制其发生率。\n　　（圆）饮食因素摇饮食因素作用比较复杂，高脂蛋白血症病人 中有相当大的比例是与饮食因素密切相关的。糖类摄入过多，可 影响胰岛素分泌，加速肝脏极低密度脂蛋白的合成，易引起高三酰 甘油血症。胆固醇和动物脂肪摄入过多与高胆固醇血症形成有 关，其他膳食成分（如长期摄入过量的蛋白质、脂肪、糖类以及膳 食纤维摄入过少等）也与本病发生有关。\n　　　继发性高脂血症系指由于其他原发疾病所引起者，这些疾病 包括糖尿病、肝病、甲状腺疾病、肾脏疾病、胰腺疾病、肥胖病、糖原 累积病、痛风、阿狄森病、库欣综合征、异常球蛋白血症等。继发性 高脂血症在临床上相当多见，如不详细检查，则其原发疾病常可被 忽略，治标而未治其本，不能从根本上解决问题，对治疗不利。\n摇摇员圆援高脂血症的中医致病原因\n近年来，我国高\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
