刺激征阳性等，腰穿或引流管内脑脊液细胞学检查和细菌培养可 以证实。治疗可遵循以下原则：\na) 选择有效及敏感抗生素\nb) 腰穿或腰池穿刺置管引流脑脊液\nc) 提高免疫力治疗（主动或被动免疫治疗）\nd) 控制体温，预防继发性损害\n　　　肺部感染： 脑出血后意识不清醒患者， 肺部感染发生率较 高。应注意肺部感染控制与呼吸道管理：\na) 昏迷患者应考虑气管插管或气管切开\nb) 保持呼吸道通畅，防治肺部感染\n　　　c) 怀疑肺部感染患者，早期痰培养及药敏实验，运用敏感有 效抗生素治疗\nd) 加强全身营养支持。\n\n11\n\n\n　　　e) 重视呼吸道管理， 有效排痰， 口腔护理， 有呼吸功能障 碍，氧饱和度下降者，尽早呼吸机支持。\n　1.4.3 体温控制： 体温升高原因：\na) 颅内血肿刺激：脑室内出血，蛛网膜下腔出血\nb) 感染：全身及颅内、肺部等各部位器官感染\nc) 中枢性高热：脑干丘脑出血或脑疝后，体温中枢功能紊乱。 降温措施包括治疗感染，物理降温及亚低温治疗。降温目标\n是将体温控制正常范围，尽量不低于35℃, 但不推荐长时间运用 亚低温治疗。\n　　　1.4.4  内环境稳定： 维持内环境稳定， 及时纠正电解质紊 乱，控制随机血糖11.1mmol/L以下。\n1.4.5 营养支持\n高血压脑出血患者术后营养支持的适应证：\na) 术前营养不良患者术后需给予营养支持；\n　　　b) 部分病人术后胃肠功能恢复缓慢，2-3天内不能恢复正常 饮食者；\nc) 手术创伤大，病人恢复较缓，短期内不能恢复正常饮食者。 但并不是每一个术后病人都需要进行营养支持， 一周内能\n恢复60%左右饮食的病人或无营养不良病人，一般不需要营养支 持。对于慢性呼吸、肾或肝功能障碍或老年病人，除非有重度营 养不良也不需要术后给予营养支持。\n　　　术后营养支持原则上以经肠营养为首选，也可以肠外营养与 经肠内营养交替应用或同时应用。营养支持量根据体重计算每日 热量25-30 KCAL/kg，若合并感染高热者应酌情增加能量供给 量。\n1.4.6 术后再出血或脑梗塞\n######################\nOutput:",
