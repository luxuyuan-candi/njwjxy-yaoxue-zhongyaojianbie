觉、妄想等精神病性症状、有双相情感障碍家族史、 抗抑郁药足量足疗程治疗不能缓解等。在这类抑郁  症患者的诊治中，要高度关注和定期随访评估躁狂  发作的可能性，以及时修正诊断和治疗方案。\n　　　3. 躯体情况所致抑郁障碍：其基本特征是突出 和持续的抑郁情绪，或几乎所有活动的兴趣或愉快 感减低为主要临床相，且抑郁状态是躯体情况直接 的生理效应所致 。躯体情况病因包括神经系统疾 病、内分泌疾病等，如脑卒中、帕金森病、脑外伤、库 欣综合征和甲状腺功能减退等 。其中甲状腺功能 减退导致抑郁症状非常常见 。因此，接诊抑郁状态 的患者要充分考虑到这些躯体情况的可能性，应进\n\n\n\n湖南药事服务网\nhttp://www.hnysfww.com/\n\n·  1254   ·
