\n　　载脂蛋白 粤与 月的比值在正常情况下应高于 员援猿园，高脂血症 时 粤与 月的比值往往降至 员援园以下。从上述可以看出，高脂血症 主要是总胆固醇升高，而其主要成分是低密度脂蛋白，低密度脂蛋 白又是与载脂蛋白 月相结合的，这就必然导致载脂蛋白 粤与 月比 值的下降。\n　　　当发现血脂化验单上的以上数值超出正常范围时，首先应该 检查一下血的样本是不是在空腹状态下采取的。 一般要求病人在 采血前一天晚 员园点钟开始禁食，于次日早上 怨点至 员园点钟采取 静脉血。其次还应注意受试者的饮酒情况，因为饮酒能明显升高 血浆中富含三酰甘油的脂蛋白及高密度脂蛋白的浓度。另外，在 分析结果时，还应考虑到脂质和脂蛋白水平本身有较大的生物学 波动，其中部分是由于季节变化、月经周期及伴发疾病等原因所 致。最后再从临床角度寻找原因。\n血脂六项的临床意义如下：\n　　员）总胆固醇：升高见于胆管梗阻、肾病综合征、慢性肾小球肾 炎、淀粉样变性、动脉粥样硬化、高血压、糖尿病、甲状腺功能减退、 传染性肝炎、门静脉性肝硬化、某些慢性胰腺炎、自发性高胆固醇 血症、家族性高 α鄄脂蛋白血症、老年性白内障及牛皮癣等；减少见 于严重贫血、急性感染、甲状腺功能亢进、脂肪痢、肺结核、先天性 血清
