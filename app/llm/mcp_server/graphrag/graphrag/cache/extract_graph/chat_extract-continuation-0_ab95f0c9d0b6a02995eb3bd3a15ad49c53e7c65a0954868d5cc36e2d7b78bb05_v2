To enhance the guidance and standardization of integrated medical and preventive management for coexisting hypertension and dyslipidemia at primary healthcare in China, we convened a group of experts to develop a consensus on standardized management. This consensus is based on an in-depth analysis of literature, extensive collection of suggestions, and practical evidence, encompassing the following aspects, background and philosophy, diagnostic criteria, management processes, organizational responsibilities and team building, quality control and continuous improvement. We anticipate that this expert consensus will contribute to the standardized management of integrated medical and preventive strategies for coexisting hypertension and dyslipidemia in primary healthcare in China.\n　[Key words] hypertension; dyslipidemia; coexistence of multiple diseases; integration of prevention and treatment; standardized management\n\n2025 年第 1 期    第 22 卷       1\n\n\n\n 标准与讨论\n\n\n\n　　心血管疾病（cardiovascular disease，CVD） 是长期以来威胁我国居民生命和健康的重大卫生问  题。我国正面临人口老龄化和代谢性疾病危险因素流  行的双重压力，CVD 发病率和死亡率持续增高，疾  病负担下降的拐点尚未出现。高血压和血脂异常均为  CVD 的危险因素［1］，会导致 CVD 发生与死亡风险  倍增。高血压和血脂异常共存已经成为我国公认的重  大公共卫生问题和社会问题，也是全球重大公共卫生  问题之一。随着我国医药卫生事业及互联网技术的逐  步融合，构建高效且易于基层推广的疾病管理模式， 已经成为基层工作亟待解决的重要问题。\n　　近年来，国内外陆续发布了多个高血压和血脂 异常相关指南及专家共识［2-3］，主要针对高血压和 血脂异常单病种/多病种共存的临床诊疗；我国基层 医疗卫生服务背景下的医防融合相关指导规范尚存 在空白。我国基层医疗卫生服务机构与互联网技术 融合相较于国外起步较晚，与社会各机构合作模式 缺乏具有可操作性的指导，医防融合整体实施未能 达到预期效果［4］。\n　　自 2015 年国务院办公厅发布《关于推进分级 诊疗制度建设的指导意见》［5］起，部分基层医疗卫 生机构进行了患者分级管理、上下转诊的模式探索， 取得了良好效果。为了在全国范围内进一步推广， 中国医院协会医共体分会、中国抗衰老促进会全科 医学应用分会、中国医药教育学会基层医药教育专 委会、广东省基层卫生协会专家协作组等专家共同 制定了《基层高血压和血脂异常共存医防融合规范 化管理中国专家共识》（以下简称“本共识”），为提 升我国基层慢病管理水平管理提供参考。\n\n1 相关疾病基本情况及研究意义\n1.1 基层高血压和血脂异常共存的现状及危害\n　　高血压和血脂异常是 CVD 的主要危险因素，以 高血压伴高胆固醇血症最为常见［1］。流行病学调查 显示［2-3］，约有 61.5% 的高血压患者合并血脂异常， 65.8% 的血脂异常患者合并高血�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHINA<|>GEO<|>China is the country where the primary healthcare system is being discussed and improved for managing hypertension and dyslipidemia)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION MEDICAL CONSORTIUM BRANCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization involved in developing the consensus on standardized management of hypertension and dyslipidemia in China)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA ANTI-AGING PROMOTION ASSOCIATION GENERAL PRACTICE MEDICINE APPLICATION BRANCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization involved in developing the consensus on standardized management of hypertension and dyslipidemia in China)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINA MEDICINE EDUCATION ASSOCIATION PRIMARY HEALTHCARE EDUCATION COMMITTEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization involved in developing the consensus on standardized management of hypertension and dyslipidemia in China)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUANGDONG PRIMARY HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATION EXPERT COOPERATION GROUP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization involved in developing the consensus on standardized management of hypertension and dyslipidemia in China)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXPERT CONSENSUS<|>EVENT<|>An event where experts developed a consensus on standardized management of hypertension and dyslipidemia in primary healthcare in China)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION MEDICAL CONSORTIUM BRANCH<|>EXPERT CONSENSUS<|>The Chinese Hospital Association Medical Consortium Branch participated in developing the expert consensus<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA ANTI-AGING PROMOTION ASSOCIATION GENERAL PRACTICE MEDICINE APPLICATION BRANCH<|>EXPERT CONSENSUS<|>The China Anti-Aging Promotion Association General Practice Medicine Application Branch participated in developing the expert consensus<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINA MEDICINE EDUCATION ASSOCIATION PRIMARY HEALTHCARE EDUCATION COMMITTEE<|>EXPERT CONSENSUS<|>The China Medicine Education Association Primary Healthcare Education Committee participated in developing the expert consensus<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUANGDONG PRIMARY HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATION EXPERT COOPERATION GROUP<|>EXPERT CONSENSUS<|>The Guangdong Primary Healthcare Association Expert Cooperation Group participated in developing the expert consensus<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXPERT CONSENSUS<|>CHINA<|>The expert consensus was developed to improve primary healthcare in China<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
