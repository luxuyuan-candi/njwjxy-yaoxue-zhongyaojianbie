红花油和葵花子油，这些油中多不饱和脂肪酸含量较高，它们可以\n降低血胆固醇水平。多不饱和脂肪酸主要有 w鄄远脂肪酸和 w鄄猿脂\n肪酸两种类型。大部分 w鄄远脂肪酸是亚油酸，存在于前面所述的 植物油中；w鄄猿脂肪酸主要存在于一些海鱼中，故而海鱼和鱼油适 合于高脂血症病人食用。\n　　　因此，高胆固醇血症和冠心病病人应选用富含多不饱和脂肪 酸的植物油。但要注意的是，油脂所含的热能高，如果过多食用， 可以引起体重的增加。\n摇摇圆缘援高脂血症病人不宜多吃瘦肉\n　　　目前社会上广泛流传这样一种观点，认为肥肉脂肪中含有大 量饱和脂肪酸，对人体有害，常食肥肉会使人发胖，会引发体内血 清胆固醇值升高，从而引发高脂血症、动脉粥样硬化、脑出血等心 血管疾病。因此，很多人只吃瘦肉，不吃肥肉。瘦肉脂肪中的饱和\n◆

圆愿援愿克。若把瘦猪肉作为日常膳食结构中主  要的食物源，也会发生高脂血症、动脉粥样硬化、脑出血等心血管  疾病。\n　　　最近，英国皇家研究院布比斯医生经过分析研究表明：多吃瘦 肉对人体健康的危害更甚于肥肉，因为瘦肉在烹制过程中，会自动 产生一种致癌物质———杂环胺。动物实验表明：杂环胺是一种损 害基因的物质，会使体内的脱氧核糖核酸（阅晕粤）发生诱变。瘦肉 中的杂环胺能被大肠直接吸收进入血液中。西方国家肠癌发病率 高于其他国家肠癌发病率，这与他们常食瘦肉，尤其喜食大量红色 牛排有关。\n　　此外，瘦肉中蛋氨酸含量较高。蛋氨酸是合成人体一些激素 和维护表皮健康必须摄取的一种氨基酸，但在一些酶类催化激活 下，在热理化处理过\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role":
