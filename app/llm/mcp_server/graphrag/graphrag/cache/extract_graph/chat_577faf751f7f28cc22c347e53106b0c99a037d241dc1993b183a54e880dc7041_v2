In  China,  gout  is  common,  but  there  is insufficient  knowledge  regarding  standardized  criteria  for  the  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  this condition.   Based   on    evidence   and   guidelines   from    China   and   other   countries,   the    Chinese Rheumatology Association developed standardized criteria for the diagnosis and treatment of gout in China. The purpose was to standardize gout diagnosis methods as well as treatment opportunities and strategies in order to reduce misdiagnosis, missed diagnosis, and irreversible damage.\n【Key words】    Gout;     Hyperuricemia;    Diagnosis;     Treatment;     Prognosis\n\n\n　　　痛风是一种单钠尿酸盐（MSU）沉积在关节所 致的晶体相关性关节病，其与嘌呤代谢紊乱和/或 尿酸排泄减少所致的高尿酸血症直接相关 。除关 节损害，痛风患者亦可伴发肾脏�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_577faf751f7f28cc22c347e53106b0c99a037d241dc1993b183a54e880dc7041_v2"}
