Tl低信号、T2高信号。MRI在发现慢性出血及脑血管畸形方面优 于CT。但MRI耗时较长，费用较高、 一般不作为ICH的首选影像 学检查[13-15]。\n　　　1.4  多模式MRI扫描： 包括弥散加权成像（D WI） 、灌 注加权成像（PWI）、水抑制成像（FLAIR）、梯度回波序列 （GRE）和磁敏感加权成像（SWI）等，它们能够对ICH提供更 多附加信息。如SWI对早期ICH及微出血较敏感[15]。\n2. 脑血管检查\n　　　脑血管检查有助于了解I CH病因和排除继发性脑出血， 指 导制定治疗方案。常用检查包括CTA、MR A、CTV、MR V、 DSA等。\n　　　2.1 CTA、MRA、CTV、MRV：是快速、无创性评价颅内 外动脉血管、静脉血管及静脉窦的常用方法，可用于筛查可能存\n\n5\n\n\n　在的脑血管畸形、动脉瘤、动静脉瘘等继发性脑出血，但阴性结 果不能完全排除继发病变的存在[16,17]。\n　　　2.2 全脑血管造影（DSA）：能清晰显示脑血管各级分支， 可以明确有无动脉瘤、A VM及其他脑血管病变，并可清楚显示 病变位置、大小、形态及分布， 目前仍是血管病变检查的重要方 法和金标准。\n3. 实验室检查\n　　　对疑似ICH患者都应进行常规的实验室检查排除相关系统疾 病，协助查找病因。最好同时完成各项手术前检查，为一旦需要 的紧急手术作好准备工作，包括血常规、血生化、凝血常规、血 型及输血前全套检查、心电图及胸部X线等检查；部分患者还可 选择毒理学筛查、动脉血气分析等检查。\n四、诊断\n　　　根据突然发病、剧烈头痛、呕吐、出现神经功能障碍等临床 症状体征，结合CT等影像学检查，ICH一般不难诊断。\n　　　但原发性脑出血、特别是高血压脑出血的诊断并无金标准， 一定要排除各种继发性脑出血疾病，避免误诊，作出最后诊断需 达到以下全部标准[18]：\n(1）有确切的高血压病史；\n　　　(2） 典型的出血部位： （包括基底节区、脑室、丘脑、脑 干、小脑半球）；\n(3）DSA/CTA/MRA排除继发性脑血管病\n　　　(4）早期（72小时内） 或晚期（血肿消失3周后） 增强MRI 检查排除脑肿瘤或海绵状血管畸形（CM）等疾病\n(5）排除各种凝血功能障碍性疾病\n\n五、治疗\n（一）内科治疗\n\n6\n\n\n　　　I CH患者在发病的最初数天内病情往往不稳定， 应常规持 续生命体征监测（包括血压监测、心电监测、氧饱和度监�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"},
