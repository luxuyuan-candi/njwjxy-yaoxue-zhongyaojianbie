诊室血压与心血管风险   诊室血压水平与心  脑血管病发病和死亡风险之间存在密切的因果关系。 在对全球 61个人群(约 100万人 ,40~ 89岁) 的前瞻  性观察研究中[44]  , 基线诊室血压从 115/75到 185/ 115mmHg,平均随访 12年 ,结果发现诊室收缩压或  舒张压与脑卒中、冠心病事件、心血管疾病死亡的风险  呈连 续、独 立、直 接 的 正 相 关 关 系 。 收 缩 压 每 升 高  20mmHg或舒张压每升高 10mmHg,心脑血管疾病  发生的风险倍增。\n　　　在 包 括 中 国 13个 人 群 在 内 的 亚 太 队 列 研 究 中[45]  ,诊室血压水平与脑卒中、冠心病事件密切相关 , 而且亚洲人群血压升高与脑卒中、冠心病事件的关系 比 澳 大 利 亚 与 新 西 兰 人 群 更 强 , 收 缩 压 每 升 高 10mmHg,亚洲人群的脑卒中和致死性心肌梗死发生 风险分别增加 53%和 31% ,而澳大利亚与新西兰人群 分别增加 24%与 21%。\n　　　近年来 , 中青年高血压人群激增 ,多表现为舒张压 增高[46] 。我国开滦研究对 87346名受试者(平均年龄 50.9岁) 的分析显示 ,与正常血压相比 ,单纯舒张期高 血压(isolated diastolic hypertension,IDH) 与脑出血 及总的心血管风险增加相关[47] 。一项纳入 15项队列 研究、489814名受试者的汇总分析发现 ,与正常血压 相比 ,IDH显著地增加了脑卒中、心血管疾病死亡及 复合心血管事件发生风险 ,亚裔及 55岁以下中青年\n\n\n\nIDH复合心血管事件显著增加[48] 。\n　　此外 , 国际多中心[49] 及我国队列研究[50-51] 显示 ,
