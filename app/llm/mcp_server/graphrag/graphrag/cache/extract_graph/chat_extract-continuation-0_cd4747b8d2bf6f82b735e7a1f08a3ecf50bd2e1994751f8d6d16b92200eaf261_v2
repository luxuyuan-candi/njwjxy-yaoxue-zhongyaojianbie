抗肿瘤治疗与高血压\n\n要点 8J  抗肿瘤治疗与高血压\n　　　·肿瘤患者高血压的治疗不仅取决于血压水平、 心血管危险分层 ,还需考虑肿瘤的预后。\n　　　· 建 议 在 肿 瘤 治 疗 期 间 血 压 目 标 值 <140/ 90mmHg,若患者合并糖尿病、CKD可将血压降至  130/80mmHg( Ⅰ ,C) 。\n　　　·推荐 ACEI或 ARB及二氢吡啶类 CCB作为初 始治疗(Ⅰ,C) 。不建议应用非二氢吡啶类 CCB(Ⅲ,C) 。\n\n　　抗肿瘤治疗可能会诱发新发高血压或导致原有高  血压恶化 。接受血管内皮生长因子抑制剂(vascularen- dothelialgrowthfactorinhibitor,VEGFi) 治疗的肿瘤患  者发生高血压的比例高达 80%[631]  ,且血压升高会出现  在起始治疗后数小时至数天内 ,血压水平与药物呈剂量  依赖性增高[632] 。其他抗肿瘤药物[化疗药物如环磷酰  胺、蛋白酶体抑制剂、多腺苷二磷酸核糖聚合酶抑制剂  和布鲁顿酪氨酸激酶(Bruton'styrosinekinase, BTK)抑  制剂]以及辅助用药(糖皮质激素、促红细胞生成素和非  甾体抗炎药)也可导致肿瘤患者出现高血压或原有高血  压恶化[108] 。\n　8.10.1  诊断及评估   抗肿瘤治疗患者的高血压诊断  标准与目前成人高血压诊断标准相同 。接受抗肿瘤药  物治疗的患者舒张压比基线升高 20 mmHg但血压  仍<140/90mmHg也 是 高 血 压 诊 断 标 准 之 一[633] 。 肿瘤患者在开始 VEGFi治疗之前应监测血压 ,在第一  个抗肿瘤治疗周期的初始阶段每周测量 1 次诊室血  压 ,之后至少每 2~3周测量 1次 。肿瘤患者血压需要  准确测量并考虑潜在的混杂因素、辅助治疗、焦虑情绪  和疼痛刺�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ACEI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ACEI is a type of antihypertensive drug
