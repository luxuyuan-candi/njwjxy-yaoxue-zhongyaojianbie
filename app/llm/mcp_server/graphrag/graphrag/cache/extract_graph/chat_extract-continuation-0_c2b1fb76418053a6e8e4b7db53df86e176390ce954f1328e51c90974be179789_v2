需实施安全诊断策略，要结合患者的病史、临床症 状和体征帮助识别疾病的危险警示信号。重点人 群若有用药疑问，可向执业药师、药学门诊进行相 应咨询，确保安全用药。\n安全诊断策略9包括以下几点：\n　　　　　(1)患者的可能诊断是什么?根据相关常见病 的症状体征、症状持续时间进行判断。\n　　　　　(2)有什么重要而不能被忽视的疾病?识别常 见警示症状。\n(3)这类情况可能忽略遗漏哪些疾病?\n(4)患者是否患有潜在的、常被掩盖的疾病?\n　　　　　(5)患者是不是还有什么话没说?鼓励患者提 供所有的健康信息。\n二、基层诊疗流程\n　　　　　常见轻微病症诊疗流程见图1。患者的疾病 管理路径情况可按人群特征进行区分。\n1.一般人群：①有用药经验者，可考虑自行管\n\n\n理；②无用药经验或有用药顾虑时，可向执业药师 咨询以协助治疗。\n　　　　　2.重点人群：可由基层全科医生提供咨询和诊 疗，院内药师提供用药指导。发现疾病严重、病情 复杂、治疗手段有限等不适合基层医疗卫生机构诊 治的，进行合理转诊。\n　　　　　其中重点人群一般包括老年人、孕产妇、儿童、 残疾人等人群，以及高血压、糖尿病、心脑血管疾病  等慢性病患者，严重精神障碍患者、农村贫困人口、 计划生育特殊家庭。\n\n\n第四部分  常见轻微病症的管理\n\n\n一 、用药基本原则\n　　　　　常见轻微病症的药物治疗大多依靠OTC药物， 公众易于掌握其使用方法，用药时间通常较短(一 般在2周以内)。公众可以根据自身需求，参考下 文各种常见轻微病症处理中列举的药物，合理准备 家 庭 药 箱 。\n　　　　　在进行治疗前，应排除各系统警示症状，并明 确没有对应药物的过敏史，才可以启动药物治疗， 同时必须密切关注病情变化。儿童需注意药物的 适用年龄，必要时咨询医生或药师。具有Rx\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS<|>EVENT<|>Allergic conjunctivitis
