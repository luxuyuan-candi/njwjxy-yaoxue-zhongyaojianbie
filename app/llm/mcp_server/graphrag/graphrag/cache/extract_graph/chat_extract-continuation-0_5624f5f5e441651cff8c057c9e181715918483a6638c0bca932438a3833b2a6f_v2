素所致高血压可口服利尿剂、CCB、ACEI/ARB。传统 改善病情抗风湿药如来氟米特、环孢素 A、他克莫司所 致高血压可采用 CCB(注意可能增加血环孢菌素浓 度)联合多种降压药包括可乐定进行治疗 。生物制剂 类抗风湿药如抗 CD20抗体可引起高血压或低血压 , 需密切监测血压 。对非甾体类抗炎药所致的高血压可 给予 CCB、中枢性降压药、ACEI/ARB、利尿剂治疗[658] 。\n8.13   围手术期高血压的管理\n\n要点 8M   围手术期高血压的管理\n　　　· 围手术期间血压增高幅度大于基础血压 30% 或血压≥140/90mmHg需对血压进行管理 ;血压控 制在<140/90mmHg( Ⅰ ,C) 。\n　　　·术前血压 ≥180/110mmHg需延迟及择期手 术( Ⅰ ,C) ;术中收缩压不应<100mmHg,平均动脉 压不应<60mmHg( Ⅲ ,C) 。\n　　　· 围手术期前已服用 β受体阻滞剂和 CCB可以 继续维持 ,术前使用 ACEI、ARB及 ARNI者 ,应停 用至少 24h( Ⅰ ,C) 。\n\n　8.13.1  定义和诱发原因    (1)定义 : 围手术期高血压  是指从确定手术治疗到与本手术有关的治疗基本结束  期间内 ,患者的血压(收缩压、舒张压或平均压) 升高幅  度大于基础血压的 30% ,或收缩压 ≥140mmHg和/ 或舒张压≥90mmHg。 围手术高血压危象指的是围  手术期的过程中出现短时间血压增高 ,并超过 180/ 110mmHg[659-662] 。\n　　　(2)诱发原因 :原发性高血压是围手术期血压升高 最主要的高危因素 ,约占 90%左右[663]  ,有继发性高血 压病史而术前血压控制不达标者 ,麻醉或镇痛不当 ,或 患者对麻醉、手术强烈的紧张、焦虑、恐惧、睡眠差 ,易 发生围手术期血压波动[660] 。\n　8.13.2  血压控制原则和目标   围手术期高血压处理 重在预防 。术前应对高血压患者的风险进行评估 。保 证重要脏器灌注 ,降低心脏后负荷 ,维护心功能 。对于\n\n\n\n　1、2级高血压(血压 <180/110mmHg) 可进行手术 ,  对进入手术室后或术前血压仍高于 180/110mmHg 的患者择期手术 ,建议推迟手术 ;对于高血压合并其他  严重疾病 ,如高血压伴急性肾衰竭、严重低钾血症(<  2.9 mmol/L)等 ,应在短时间内采取措施改善靶器官\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
