制，能够有效地控制体重，达到降低血脂和减肥的效果，而最新的 实验结果也刚好证明了这一点。\n（员）有氧练习彻底降脂摇小鼠实验抗击动脉硬化是一个从分\n子角度研究有氧运动减脂机制的实验。北京大学三院运动医学研 究所陈吉棣教授和她的研究生们，利用已处于高脂血症水平的小 鼠进行实验。他们让这些高脂血症小鼠每天进行有氧运动（让小 鼠游泳、跑步），远～愿周后发现，这些小鼠的血脂水平有了显著的 降低，高密度脂蛋白水平显著增高，而动脉粥样硬化斑块的形成也 得到了明显抑制。\n　　　实验证明，有氧运动之所以能够降低血脂，是因为它可以提高 高密度脂蛋白受体的基因表达水平，使低密度脂蛋白水平下降，高 密度脂蛋白水平上升，促进了脂肪代谢。\n　　（圆）有氧运动最耗脂肪摇运动能够增加人体内能量的消耗。 走路、跑步或游泳的能量消耗可以是静坐的几到几十倍。研究数 据表明，当体力活动的消耗达到每天
