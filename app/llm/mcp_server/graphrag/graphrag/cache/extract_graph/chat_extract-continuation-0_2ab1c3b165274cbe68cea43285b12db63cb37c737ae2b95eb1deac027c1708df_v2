生活中控制血脂过高，首先是从饮食中控制。这包括两个方面：一 是控制高胆固醇食物的摄入，二是多吃些有降低胆固醇作用的 食物。\n　　在饮食中，动物性脂肪，动物的脑、肝、肾，鸡蛋黄，鸭蛋黄，鹅 蛋黄，松花蛋，虾子，蟹黄等食物，胆固醇含量很高，应控制食用量。 以人们常吃的鸡蛋为例，每个蛋黄约含有 猿圆园毫克胆固醇，以每天 吃 员个鸡蛋为宜；如果不是血脂过高，也不必只吃蛋清不吃蛋黄。 控制纯糖和脂肪有利于降低三酰甘油。\n◆                                                                                                  摇怨\n\n\n\n\n\t 高脂血症防治      \n　　含胆固醇较低或有降低胆固醇作用的食物，比如谷类、瘦肉、 鸡鸭肉、鱼类（尤其是海产鱼）、海参、海带、薯类、香蕉等食品，以 及植物油（尤其是芝麻油、花生油、玉米油），应在日常膳食中适量 增加。摄入牛奶、豆类或其制品还可补钙，也有利于控制胆固醇。 喝茶，尤其是绿茶也有降低血脂作用。\n　　经发现，大蒜有升高血液中高密度脂蛋白、增强胆固醇分解、 排出的作用。大豆及豆制品对降低血液中低密度脂蛋白有明显作 用。香菇、木耳可降低血液中的胆固醇和三酰甘油。洋葱对防止 胆固醇在动脉血管壁上的沉积也有一定作用。\n　　在饮食控制的同时，坚持体育健身运动，有利于消耗体内脂 肪，并加速血液运行，不使血流淤滞，有利于防止胆固醇在血管壁 沉积。在全民健身运动中，选定自己的运动项目常年坚持，还有利 于保持适宜体重。\n　　还要勤于用脑，人的大脑只有体重的 圆豫，却在消耗人体 圆园豫  的热量，勤于用脑（尤其是老年人）将有利于减少体内脂肪堆积，
