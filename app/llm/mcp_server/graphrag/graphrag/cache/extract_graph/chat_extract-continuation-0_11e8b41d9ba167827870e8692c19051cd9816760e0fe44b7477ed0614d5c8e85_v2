。\n　　　中年高血压与老年认知能力下降和痴呆症风险之  间的关联最强[533-535] 。一项大样本荟萃分析显示中年  高血 压、收 缩 压 升 高 和 舒 张 压 升 高 均 增 加 痴 呆 风  险[56] 。多数研究认为高血压与认知障碍的关联呈 J 形[536-537] 。 中国一项纵向研究表明 , 80岁以上老年人  收缩压在 130~150mmHg时认知障碍风险最低[538] 。 青 年 或 儿 童 期 高 血 压 已 对 认 知 功 能 有 负 面 影  响[539-542]  ,高血压对认知功能的不利影响可能在中年  之前就存在 。另外 BPV、夜间非勺型血压、体位性低  血压与认知障碍和痴呆风险增加相关[543-545] 。\n　　合理的降压治疗在高血压患者中具有认知保护作  用 ,在高血压合并认知障碍患者中仍应进行降压治疗。 荟萃分析显示 ,降低血压对延缓痴呆或认知障碍的发  展有一定的益处[538,546-548] 。在临床试验中治疗高血压  可在一定程度上降低痴呆和阿尔茨海默病风险 ,观察  性研究也发现了类似的风险降低[549] 。\n　8.2.2   降压目标   虽然长期队列研究显示降压治疗  可降低痴呆风险 ,但血压控制目标对认知功能的影响  仍未完全明确 , 尚不能根据高血压患者认知功能设立  血压控制目标 。建议一般高血压合并认知障碍患者可  将血压降至<140/90mmHg,如可耐受可降至<130/ 80mmHg。对于存在严重认知功能减退甚至痴呆的  独居患者 ,过于严格的血压控制可能具有潜在的不利  影响 ,宜采取较为宽松的血压控制策略 , 可将<150/ 90mmHg作为血压初步控制目标 。年龄 ≥80岁的患  者 ,如血压 ≥150/90mmHg,在改善生活方式的同时  启动降压药物治疗 ,将血压降至<150/90mmHg,若  耐受良好 ,则进一步将血压降至<140/90mmHg;如\n\n\n存在衰弱 ,应根据患者具体情况设立个体化血压控制 目标[550] 。\n　8.2.3  药物治疗   常用降压药均可应用于高血压合 并认知障碍的治疗 。报告认知结局的随机对照试验涉 及多种降压药 ,欧洲收缩期高血压研究是第一项证明 CCB降压治疗可以显著降低痴呆发生风险的随机对 照试验[551]  ,PROGRESS研究表明培哚普利可减轻高 血压患者的血管性认知障碍[552] 。\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EUROPEAN SYSTOLIC HYPERTENSION STUDY<|>EVENT<|>A
