清除血肿，直视下止血也较满意。\n　　　于患者颞骨上作平行于外侧裂投影线的皮肤切 口 ，长约 4-5cm，在颞骨上钻孔1-2孔，用铣刀铣成直径3CM左右游离骨 瓣，硬脑膜十字切开。在颞上回或颞中回脑针穿刺，确定血肿部 位后作脑皮质切口，切口长约1cm，用小号脑压板逐渐向深部分 离进入血肿腔，轻柔吸除血肿。彻底止血且确认脑压不高，脑搏 动良好后，缝合硬脑膜，固定颅骨骨瓣，逐层缝合头皮。\n1.2.3 神经内镜血肿清除术\n　　　采用硬质镜与立体定向技术相结合来清除血肿。在CT或B超 定位下穿刺血肿腔，在不损伤血管壁、周围脑组织及不引起新的 出血的前提下尽可能清除血肿，但不必强求彻底清除，以免引起 新的出血，达到减压目的即可，然后放置引流管作外引流，如遇 有小动脉出血，可以通过内镜的工作道用高频射频凝固止血。\n1.2.4 立体定向骨孔血肿抽吸术（改良椎颅术）\n　　　根据CT定位血肿部位， 采用立体定向头架定位或标尺定 位 ，避开重要血管和功能 区 ，选择局部浸润麻醉 ，小直切 口 （2cm）切开头皮，钻孔后切开硬脑膜，在直视下运用一次性颅 内血肿粉碎穿刺针或普通吸引器等器械穿刺血肿，首次抽吸血肿 量不作限制，应以减压为目的，血肿腔留置引流通道或引流管持\n\n10\n\n\n续引流3～5d。\n1.3 手术要点\n　　　无论采用何种入路和术式，都要避免或尽量减少手术对脑组
