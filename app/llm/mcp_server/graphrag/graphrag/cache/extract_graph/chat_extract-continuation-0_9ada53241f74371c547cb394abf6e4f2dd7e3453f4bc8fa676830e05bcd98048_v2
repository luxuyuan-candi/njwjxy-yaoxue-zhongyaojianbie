摩尔辕升（圆猿园毫克辕分升），这个标准相当陈旧荒谬，极不利于心血  管疾病的预防与治疗。事实上，早在 员怨苑年，《中华心血管病杂  志》就发表了降脂治疗目标值：高脂血症没有危险因素者，总胆固  醇≤缘援苑毫摩尔辕升（圆园毫克辕分升）；高脂血症伴有危险因素者， 总胆固醇 ≤缘援圆毫摩尔辕升（圆园毫克辕分升）；冠心病伴有高脂血  症者，总胆固醇≤源援苑毫摩尔辕升（员愿园毫克辕分升）。也就是说，如  果一个冠心病病人经治疗总胆固醇从 远援圆毫摩尔辕升（圆源园毫克辕 分升）降到缘援源毫摩尔辕升（圆员园毫克辕分升），并不意味着血脂已控  制到正常水平。\n◆                                                                                                  摇摇\n\n\n\n\n\t 高脂血症防治      \n　　对降脂治疗的忽视已是普遍现象。近来，在全国 员愿家三级甲 等医院进行的一项调查显示，员园例高脂血症病人经入院治疗， 血脂治疗达标率仅为 员园援员豫，其中冠心病伴高脂血症病人血脂治 疗达标率尤低，仅为 缘援员豫。另一项在全国 圆家三级甲等医院的 调查则显示，圆圆园例住院冠心病病人，竟有猿缘援怨豫未接受任何降 脂治疗。\n　　病人未接受或未充分接受降脂治疗的原因包括：医生对于降 脂治疗所带来的临床效益认识不足，对开始进行药物降脂治疗的 血脂标准及应达到的理想目标水平不明确，对降脂治疗可能产生 的不良反应疑虑过多，对饮食治疗效果过于乐观，对成本效益评估 不恰当。\n　　　临床医生的治疗没有系统工程配套，其作用会大打折扣。医 生搭完桥就万事大吉，病人以后吃不吃药没人管。病人也以为一 次手术就根治了，不知道要吃药、吃什么药、吃多久，也不知道如何 保持健康生活方式。 在我国，很长一段时间内，心肌梗死、心绞痛 或冠心病术后的病人，一部分死于院外，一小部分死于院中，一大 部分死于出院后没有系统管理而复发。\n摇摇猿援提高高脂血症治疗中的“三低”现象\n　　　目前我国的冠心病病人或高危人群，甚至医护人员对高脂血  症\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
