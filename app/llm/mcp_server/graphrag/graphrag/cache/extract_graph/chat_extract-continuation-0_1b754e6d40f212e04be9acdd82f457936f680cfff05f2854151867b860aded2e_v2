CCB为基础的积极降压治疗方案可显著降低我国高 血压 患 者 脑 卒 中 的 发 生 与 死 亡 率 。 在 此 基 础 上 , FEVER研究显示 ,氢氯噻嗪加非洛地平与单用氢氯 噻嗪相比 ,尽管加用非洛地平组只进一步使收缩压/舒 张压降低了 4/2mmHg,但致死与非致死性脑卒中的 发生降低了 27%[222] 。进一步进行 FEVER试验事后\n\n\n　分析发现 ,治疗后平均血压水平低于 120/70mmHg 时 ,脑卒中、心脏事件和总死亡危险最低 。老年患者中  收缩压<140mmHg较更高的血压治疗组获益更为  明显[223-224] 。脑卒中后降压治疗研究(post-stroke an- tihypertensivetreatmentstudy,PATS)是国际上第一  个较大规模的安慰剂对照的脑卒中后二级预防降压治  疗临床试验 ,结果表明 , 吲达帕胺(2.5 mg/d) 治疗组  与安慰剂组相比 ,血压降低了 5/2mmHg,脑卒中的  发生率降低了 29%[225-226] 。正常高值血压干预预防高  血压研究选择正常高值血压者(收缩压/舒张压 130~  139/80~89mmHg) 进行降压治疗 ,未观察到降低血  压的临床获益。\n　　　我国参加的国际多中心降压治疗临床试验 :我国  学者也参加了脑卒中后降压治疗预防再发研究(per- indopril
