过度加工，少用油炸、油煎等多油烹饪方法，多选择蒸、煮 等方式。\n（三）食物多样，蛋白质和膳食纤维摄入充足。\n　　　　在控制总能量及脂肪的基础上，选择食物多样的平衡膳 食模式，食物每天应不少于 12 种，每周不少于 25 种。\n　　　　碳水化合物摄入量应占总能量的 50%～ 60%，以成年人每 日能量摄入 1800～ 2000kcal 为例，相当于全天碳水化合物 摄入量在 225～ 300g 之间。在主食中应适当控制精白米面摄 入，适量多吃含膳食纤维丰富的食物，如全谷物、杂豆类、 蔬菜等。膳食纤维在肠道与胆酸结合，可减少脂类的吸收， 从而降低血胆固醇水平。同时，高膳食纤维可降低血胰岛素 水平，提高人体胰岛素敏感性，有利于脂代谢的调节。推荐 每日膳食中包含 25～ 40g 膳食纤维（其中 7～ 13g 水溶性膳 食纤维）。多食新鲜蔬菜，推荐每日摄入 500g，深色蔬菜应 当占一半以上。新鲜水果每日推荐摄入 200～ 350g。\n　　　　蛋白质摄入应充足。动物蛋白摄入可适当选择脂肪含量 较低的鱼虾类、去皮禽肉、瘦肉等；奶类可选择脱脂或低脂 牛奶等。应提高大豆蛋白等植物性蛋白质的摄入，每天摄入 含 25g 大豆蛋白的食品，可降低发生心血管疾病的风险。\n（四） 少盐控糖，戒烟限酒。\n\n　　　　高脂血症是高血压、糖尿病、冠心病、脑卒中的重要危 险因素，为预防相关并发症的发生，要将血脂、血压、血糖 控制在理想水平。高脂血症人群膳食除了控制脂肪摄入量， 还要控制盐和糖的摄入量。培养清淡口味，食盐用量每日不 宜超过 5g。同时， 少吃酱油、鸡精、味精、咸菜、咸肉、酱 菜等高盐食品。限制单糖和双糖的摄入，少吃甜食，添加糖 摄入不应超过总能量的 10%，肥胖和高甘油三酯血症者添加 糖摄入应更低。\n　　　　高脂血症人群生活作息应规律，保持乐观、愉快的情绪， 劳逸结合，睡眠充足，戒烟限酒，培养健康生活习惯。完全 戒烟和有效避免吸入二手烟，有利于预防动脉粥样硬化性心 血管�\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>N-3
