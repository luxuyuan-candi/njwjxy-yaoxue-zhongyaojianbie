高血压脑病、颅内出血(脑出血和蛛网膜下腔出血) 、脑  梗死、急性心力衰竭、肺水肿、急性冠脉综合征(不稳定  型心绞痛、急性非 ST段抬高和 ST段抬高心肌梗死) 、 主动脉夹层、嗜铬细胞瘤危象、使用毒品(安非他明、可  卡因、迷幻药等)、围手术期高血压、子痫等[108,144] 。\n　　应注意血压水平的高低与急性靶器官损害的程度 并非成正比 。一部分高血压急症并不伴有特别高的血 压值 ,如并发于妊娠期或某些急性肾小球肾炎的患者 , 血压不及时控制在合理范围内会对脏器功能产生严重 影响 ,甚至危及生命 ,处理过程中需要高度重视 。并发 急性肺水肿、主动脉夹层、心肌梗死者 , 即使血压仅为 中度升高 ,也应视为高血压急症。\n　11.1.2  高血压亚急症   高血压亚急症是指血压显著 升高但不伴靶器官损害 。患者可以有血压明显升高造 成的症状 ,如头痛、胸闷、鼻出血、烦躁不安等 。相当多 数的患者有服药依从性不好或治疗不足[108,144] 。\n　11.1.3  高血压急症和亚急症的区别   血压升高的程 度不是区别高血压急症与高血压亚急症的标准 , 区别 高血压急症与亚急症的唯一标准是有无新近发生\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
