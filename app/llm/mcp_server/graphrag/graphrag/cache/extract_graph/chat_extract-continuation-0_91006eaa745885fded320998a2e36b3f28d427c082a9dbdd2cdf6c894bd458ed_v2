病是威胁中老年人健康的第一大杀手，高脂血症、糖尿病、肥胖病 等相关性十分密切的病症，其相加总发病率为 员园豫，考虑到复合 患病因素，仍然是严重的问题。\n　　　中医认为，膏脂虽为人体的营养物质，但过多则形成高脂血 症。凡导致人体摄入膏脂过多，以及膏脂转输、利用、排泄失常的 因素均可使血脂升高，其病因有以下几点：\n　　（员）饮食失当摇饮食不节，摄食过度，或恣食肥腻甘甜厚味， 过多膏脂随饮食进入人体，输布、转化不及，潴留血中，因而血脂升 高；长期饮食失当，或酗酒过度，损及脾胃，健运失司，致使饮食不 归正化，不能化精微以营养全身，反而变生脂浊，混入血中，引起血 脂升高。前者为实证，后者为虚中夹实证，这是两者不同之处。\n　　（圆）喜静少动或生性喜静摇贪睡少动，或因职业工作所限，终 日伏案，多坐少走，人体气机失于疏畅，气郁则津液输布不利，膏脂 转化利用不及，以致生多用少，沉积体内，浸淫血中，故血脂升高。\n　　（猿）情志刺激摇思虑伤脾，脾失健运，或郁怒伤肝，肝失条达， 气机不畅，膏脂运化输布失常，血脂升高。\n　　（源）年老体衰摇人老则五脏六腑皆衰，以肾为主，肾主五液， 肾虚则津液失其主宰；脾主运化，脾虚则饮食不归正化；肝主疏泄， 肝弱则津液输布不利，三者皆使膏脂代谢失常，引起血脂升高。若 房劳过度，辛劳忧愁，亦可使人未老而先衰。\n　　（缘）体质禀赋摇父母肥胖，自幼多脂，成年以后，形体更加丰 腴，而阳气常多不足，津液膏脂输化迟缓，血中育质过多；或素体阴 虚阳亢，脂化为育，溶入血中，血脂升高。\n　　（远）消渴、水肿、胁痛、黄疸、瘩积等证不愈摇消渴证基本病机 属阴虚燥热，由于虚火内扰，胃热杀谷\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
