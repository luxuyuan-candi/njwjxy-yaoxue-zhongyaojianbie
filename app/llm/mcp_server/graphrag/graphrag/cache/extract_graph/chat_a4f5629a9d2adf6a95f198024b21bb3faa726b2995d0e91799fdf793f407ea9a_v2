In recent decades，the prevalence of dyslipidemia in the Chinese population increases continuously，it is urgent to improve blood lipid management in China. It is particularly important to carry out standardized blood lipid management at primary healthcare institutions. The Chinese Guideline for Lipid Management（Primary Care Version 2024 ）concisely recommends that LDL-C should be the preferred intervention target in lipid management，and the target values of LDL-C should be determined based on ASCVD risk stratification. The present guideline recommends to use moderate-intensity statins at the beginning of treatment on the basis of lifestyle intervention. If the LDL-C target level can not be reached，other lipid-lowering drugs like cholesterol absorption inhibitors or（and）proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors should be jointly used for the purpose of reaching the target value. The present guideline also provides blood lipid management strategies for special populations. We aim to provide guidance for primary healthcare professionals to carry out blood lipid management，and comprehensively improve their ability on blood lipid management，and thereby improve the primary and secondary prevention of ASCVD in China.\n　　【 Key words 】  Atherosclerosis；Cardiovascular disease；Blood lipid management；Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol；Primary healthcare institution\n\n\n　　以 动 脉 粥 样 硬 化 性 心 血 管 疾 病（atherosclerotic cardiovascular\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "deepseek-chat", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_a4f5629a9d2adf6a95f198024b21bb3faa726b2995d0e91799fdf793f407ea9a_v2"}
