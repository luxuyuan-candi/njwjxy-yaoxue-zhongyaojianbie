d内常规治疗组大约12.1%出现DVT，而肢体应用气压助动的患者有8.5%发生DVT，两者差异有统计学意义。一项荟萃分析结果表明，低分子肝素皮下注射对预防和治疗缺血性卒中后DVT和肺栓塞是有明确疗效的，高剂量相关的出血不良反应也明显增多，每天3 000～6 000 U是合适的，且不显著增加出血风险[49]。目前应用的几种预防脑卒中患者DVT的方法包括早期运动、抗凝、间歇性气压静脉驱动、弹力袜等，研究认为药物预防和穿弹力袜能明显降低DVT的发生。虽然没有直接临床证据支持，但是组织化卒中机构均认为，早期运动可能对防止DVT非常重要[48,50]。\n　　推荐意见：(1)对所有脑卒中的患者均应评价DVT的风险。重症卒中、卧床、制动、心力衰竭、感染、脱水、肢体骨折等是脑卒中急性期DVT形成的危险因素，早期下床、康复是预防DVT的有效方法(Ⅰ级推荐)。(2)对有高度DVT或肺栓塞危险的特定患者，可给予预防剂量的肝素或低分子肝素，在使用7～10 d后要进行血小板计数检查(Ⅱ级推荐，B级证据)。(3)可考虑应用分级弹力袜及间歇气动压力装置作为辅助治疗措施(Ⅱ级推荐，B级证据)。(4)对有肺栓塞风险同时有抗凝禁忌的患者可考虑安置临时或永久性下腔静脉滤器(Ⅱ级推荐，B级证据)。\n脑卒中早期康复护理\n　　康复护理是脑卒中早期康复的重要内容，康复护士是多学科治疗团队的重要成员，康复护士需要接受正规的康复培训，除掌握基本的护理知识外，还要掌握基本的康复护理知识，包括卒中患者的皮肤管理、大小便功能的管理和康复、良肢位的摆放和体位转移、吞咽障碍的临床评估和吞咽康复指导、营养管理和进食管理技术训练、呼吸道管理和基本的呼吸功能康复技术等。研究表明，有效的康复护理能明显提高卒中患者功能恢复、减少并发症、提高ADL能力[51,52]。\n　　推荐意见：(1)建议神经内科或卒中单元加强脑卒中患者早期的康复护理工作(Ⅰ级推荐)。(2)建议加强康复护理的健康宣教和护理指导，以调动患者本人、家属及其他护理人员的参与意识和康复信心，提高脑卒中整体的康复质量(Ⅰ级推荐，A级证据)。\n　　执笔　张通、赵军\n专家委员会成员\n　　专家委员会成\n######################\nOutput:",
