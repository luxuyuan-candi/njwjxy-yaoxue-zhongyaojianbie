，可以致残、致死的疾病。\n降脂误区二：没有感觉就没有疾病。\n　　　高脂血症最危险的正是它不易为人们所察觉，在疾病较轻的 时候没有任何感觉，必须通过化验才能发现。高脂血症是无形的 杀手，它在我们青年时代就开始侵蚀血管，中年时病情发展，但可 能没有任何感觉，直至中老年时，它造成了心脑血管疾病并产生了 心绞痛、心肌梗死、偏瘫等严重的症状甚至危及生命的时候，人们 才真正引起警惕。但那时带来的可能会是不可逆转的心脑损害， 甚至生命的代价。\n◆                                                                                                  摇摇\n\n\n\n\n\t 高脂血症防治      \n　　所以世界卫生组织（宰匀韵）提出：正常人应该每 圆年检查一次 血脂，源园岁以上的人应每 员年检查一次血脂，体型肥胖者，长期吃 糖太多，长期吸烟、酗酒，习惯静坐，生活无规律，情绪易激动，精神 常处于紧张状态者，已经患有心血管疾病如冠心病、高血压、脑血 栓及患有高脂血症的病人，或者有黄色瘤，应在医生的指导下定期 检查血脂。\n　　没有感觉一样存在疾病，定期检查、早期诊断、早期治疗是 关键。\n降脂误区三：只要血脂正常了，就可以停药了。\n　　　当血脂降到接近期望水平，应适当减少用药剂量，长期小量维 持治疗，而不应立即完全停药。这是因为高脂血症除有外界原因， 如饮食、运动等，还有自身代谢、遗传等原因，它们在体内长期影响 着血脂。例如胆固醇的产生主要是体内小肠、皮肤和肝脏（约 愿园豫），仅有 圆园豫是由食物提供的，所以体内代谢等因素非常重 要。对于高脂血症的治疗正如高血压、糖尿病的治疗一样，目前还 需长期服药，有的甚至需终身服用。任何一种降脂药物，都无法达 到“一劳永逸”的效果，一旦停药，血脂往往又恢复至治疗前水平。 长期坚持服药，我们近期看到的是血脂指标的改善，远期受益的将 是心脑血管疾病发生率、死亡率的大幅度降低，所以长期服药是有 其中的道理可寻的。\n（四）降脂可防冠心病\n摇摇猿缘援降脂药物减缓动脉硬化\n　　　经长期的临床观察，肯定了降脂药物治疗可以使动脉内膜粥 样斑块缩小。有人通过彩色电脑声像仪，对发现颈动脉内膜有突 起斑块的病人，采用降脂药物（辛伐他汀）治疗，每晚口服\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
