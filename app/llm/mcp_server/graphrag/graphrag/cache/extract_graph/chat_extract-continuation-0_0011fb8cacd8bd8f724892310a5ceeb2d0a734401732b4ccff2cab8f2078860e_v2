的分类，欧洲将ICH分为原发性脑出血（Primary ICH）、继发 性脑出血（Secondary ICH）和原因不明性脑出血[9]；美国有学 者将I CH命名为非动脉瘤性、非A VM性、非肿瘤性自发性脑出 血。原发性脑出血与继发性脑出血的分类，目前得到较多认可。\n　　　继发性脑出血一般指有明确病因的脑出血， 多由脑动静脉畸 形、脑动脉瘤、使用抗凝药物、溶栓治疗、抗血小板治疗、凝血功 能障碍、脑肿瘤、脑血管炎、硬脑膜动静脉瘘、烟雾病（Moyamoya 病）、静脉窦血栓形成等引起[9,10] ，占ICH的15%～20%。\n　　　原发性脑出血指无明确病因的脑出血， 多数合并有高血压。 在我国， 虽未进行大样本流行病学调查， 但就现有文献资料分 析，原发性脑出血合并高血压者可高达70％～80％[11] ，所以我国 一直沿用“高血压脑出血”命名。而在国外医学文献中， 多将该 病统称为脑出血或自发性脑出血，约占所有ICH的80％～85%。\n本指导规范仅限于原发性脑出血的诊断及治疗。\n\n三、辅助检查\n1. 影像学检查\n\n4\n\n\n　　　影像学检查是诊断I C H的重要方法， 主要包括： 脑CT、 MRI和脑血管造影等。CT及MRI能够反映出血的部位、出血 量、波及范围及血肿周围脑组织情况。\n　　　1.1 CT扫描：使用广泛，ICH在CT上表现为高密度影，是 诊断脑卒中首选的影像学检查方法[12]。可根据多田公式粗略计算 血肿体积：血肿体积T(ml)=π/6 *L*S*Slice，式中L为血肿的长 轴，S为短轴，Slice为所含血肿层面的厚度（cm）；目前有相关 软件可根据CT图像精确计算血肿体积。\n　　　1.2 多模式CT扫描： 包括CT脑灌注成像（C TP） 和增强 CT。CTP能够反映ICH后脑组织的血供变化，可了解血肿周边血 流灌注情况。增强CT扫描发现造影剂外溢是提示患者血肿扩大 风险高的重要证据[6]。\n　　　1.3 MRI扫描：ICH在MRI上的表现较复杂，根据血肿的时 间长短而有所不同：超急性期(0～2h)：血肿为T1低信号、T2高 信号，与脑梗死不易区别；急性期(2～72h)：T1等信号、T2低信 号；亚急性期(3天～3周)：T1、T2均呈高信号；慢性期(>3周)： Tl低信号、T2高信号。MRI在发现慢性出血及脑血管畸形方面优 于CT。但MRI耗时较长，费用较高、 一般不作为ICH的首选影\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
