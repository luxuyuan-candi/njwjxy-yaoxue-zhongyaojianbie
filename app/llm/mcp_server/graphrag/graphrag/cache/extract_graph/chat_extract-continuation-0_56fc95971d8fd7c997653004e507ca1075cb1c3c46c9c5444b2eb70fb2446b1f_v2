(34%)、肌肉疼痛(34%)和胃部不适(22%)?。\n　　　　　常见轻微病症带来了较重的医疗负担，而通过  社区药店充分管理这类健康问题具有显著的成本  效益。上述英国相关研究估算，如果这些轻微病症 在社区药店充分管理，每年可以节省约11亿英镑  的医疗费用2]。在加拿大，约有七分之一的居民  (约500万名)完全依赖医生来处理轻微症状，如果  这些人中有16%能够积极自我管理，那么将有额外 的50万名加拿大居民能够获得家庭医生的服务。 在加拿大安大略省，大约13%的就诊是针对感冒或 流感，占政府向医生支付医疗费用的12.5%。工作 量方面，轻微病症占医生全部工作量的10%~20%。 加拿大药店管理常见轻微病症平均每次成本为  29.30英镑，而全科医生和急诊的管理成本分别需 82.34英镑和147.09英镑8。\n　　　　　在积极改善常见轻微病症服务的地区，药店的 专业服务逐渐得到社会认可。在英国，对比15年前， 医护人员认为只有37%的轻微病症适合在社区药店  管理，而这一比例在推行常见轻微病症服务(minor   ailment   service,MAS)多年以后提升至59%。这可能 是社区药店的服务范围和能力明显提升后，全科医 生和患者对社区药店的信任度升高的结果2。\n三、常见轻微病症目录\n常见轻微病症目录的形成参考了国外发布的\n\n· 528
