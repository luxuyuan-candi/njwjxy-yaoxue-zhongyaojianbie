管理中结合科学证据和卫生经济学原则做两个层 次推荐，即基本推荐和优化推荐。\n一、定义与分类\n　　　高血压定义：未使用降压药物的情况下，非同 日3次测量诊室血压，收缩压(SBP)≥140mmHg    (1mmHg=0.133kPa)      和/或舒张压(DBP)≥90     mmHg。 SBP≥140mmHg 和 DBP<90 mmHg为单纯收缩期 高血压。患者既往有高血压史，目前正在使用降 压药物，血压虽低于140/90 mmHg,仍应诊断高 血压 。\n　　　根据血压升高水平，进一步将高血压分为1、2 和3级1。血压水平分类和定义见表1。\n表 1 血压水平分类和定义\n\n分类\t收缩压(mmHg)\t\t舒张压(mmHg)\n正常血压\t<120\t和\t<80\n正常高值\t120~139\t和/或\t80~89\n高血压\t≥140\t和/或\t≥90\n1级高血压(轻度)\t140~159\t和/或\t90~99\n2级高血压(中度)\t160~179\t和/或\t100~109\n3级高血压(重度)\t≥180\t和/或\t≥110\n单纯收缩期高血压\t≥140\t和\t<90\n　　注：当收缩压和舒张压分属于不同级别时，以较高的分级为 准；1mmHg=0.133 kPa\n\n\n二、诊断、危险分层与转诊\n(一)诊断及评估[1-2]\n　　1.血压测量：在临床和人群防治工作中，主要 采用诊室血压测量和诊室外血压测量，后者包括动 态血压监测(ABPM) 和家庭血压监测(HBPM) 。 不 同血压测量方法的评价和高血压的诊断标准 见表2。\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
