先选择不饱和脂肪酸（如植物油和鱼油）替代动物 脂肪和棕榈油，并避免摄入反式脂肪酸，这有助于 降低冠心病风险［25］。此外，限制膳食胆固醇摄入量 （每日低于 300 mg）可降低 TC、LDL?C 水平，进而降 低心血管疾病和全因死亡风险［26］。应增加富含 ω?3 脂肪酸食物（如鱼类 、坚果等）的摄入量，以降 低 TG 水平，降低心血管不良事件风险［27］。摄入蔬 菜和水果对降低 LDL?C 水平有益［28］，而富含膳食纤\n维的食物（如燕麦、大麦、豆类、苹果和柑橘类水果\n\n\n　等）有助于降低血清 TC 和 LDL?C，同时对血压和血 糖控制、体重管理、免疫功能提升等均具有积极作 用［29］。推广健康膳食模式，如终止高血压膳食疗法 和地中海饮食，已被证实能有效降低 TC 和LDL?C 水平，降低心血管疾病风险［30?33］。\n　　　2. 身体活动：规律的有氧运动对提升 HDL?C 水  平、降低 TG 及小而密 LDL 颗粒浓度具有积极作用， 这有助于改善心血管疾病预后［34］。成年人每周应  至少进行 150 min 中等强度运动或 75 min 高强度运  动，以有效降低心血管疾病风险 。应根据代谢当量  （ metabolic  equivalent ，MET ）判 断 运 动 强 度 ，1~  <3 MET 为低强度，3~<6 MET 为中等强度，≥6 MET  为高强度 。MET 指安静休息时身体活动的能量代  谢水平，表现为单位时间能量消耗量 。1 MET 相当  于每小时每公斤体重消耗 1 kcal 能量［35］。\n　　　推荐的运动方式包括快走、慢跑、游泳、骑自行 车等有氧运动，以及瑜伽、太极拳等适合老年人的 活动，这些运动有助于提升心肺功能 。此外，抗阻 训练，如使用健身器械或弹力带，不仅能增强身体 机能，还对血糖、血压控制有积极作用［35］。\n　　　3. 控制体重：体重管理对于改善血脂异常至关 重要 。减重能够优化血脂谱，降低 TG、LDL?C 和 TC 水平，同时提高 HDL?C 水平［36］。理想的体重控制 目标是维持体重指数（BMI）在 18.5~23.9 kg/m2，腰 围男性不超过 85 cm、女性不超过 80 cm。\n　　4. 戒烟、限酒：吸烟会损害血脂谱，导致 TG 升 高、HDL?C 降低，增加心血管疾病风险，并影响血管 功能［37］。因此，强烈建议\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CORONARY HEART DISEASE<|>EVENT<|>A condition that can be
