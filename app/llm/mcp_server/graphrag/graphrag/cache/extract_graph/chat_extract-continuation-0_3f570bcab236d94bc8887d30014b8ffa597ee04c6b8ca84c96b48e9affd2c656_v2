神经免疫学研究：人体免疫系统与中枢神 经系统具有密切联系 。观察到的现象有：用细胞 因子进行免疫治疗的患者常表现出一系列抑郁样 症状，而抗抑郁药能改善这些症状；免疫系统疾病 如类风湿性关节炎 、系统性红斑狼疮常伴有抑郁 表现；动物实验中发现细胞因子可引起动物出现 抑郁样行为，并能被抗抑郁药治疗所逆转 。有关 应激事件对免疫系统影响的研究也证实了这种密 切联系 。情绪障碍和应激事件可以影响免疫功 能 ，而免疫功能的改变也可能成为抑郁障碍的 病因。\n　　　3. 睡眠与脑电生理研究：脑电图研究发现，抑 郁障碍患者左右脑半球平均整合振幅与抑郁严重 程度呈负相关，且脑电图异常有侧化现象，右半球 的激活程度升高 。这种激活程度升高主要表现在 额区，尤其以右额叶为主，并认为与抑郁情绪产生\n\n\n\n湖南药事服务网\nhttp://www.hnysfww.com/\n\n中华全科医师杂志 2021 年
