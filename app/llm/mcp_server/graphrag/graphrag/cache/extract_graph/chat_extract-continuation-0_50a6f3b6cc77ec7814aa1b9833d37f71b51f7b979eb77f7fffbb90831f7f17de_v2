腺炎，加重肝炎症状，导致男性性功能障碍、老年性痴呆等疾病。 最新研究提示高脂血症可能与癌症的发病有关。\n　　　高脂血症对身体的损害是隐匿、逐渐、进行性和全身性的。它 的直接损害是加速全身动脉粥样硬化，因为全身的重要器官都要 依靠动脉供血、供氧，一旦动脉被粥样斑块堵塞，就会导致严重后 果。动脉硬化引起的肾功能衰竭等都与高脂血症密切相关。\n　　　高脂血症是引起冠心病、高血压、动脉硬化等的直接原因，医 学专家称其为导致心脑血管疾病的“导火线”。因此高脂血症、高 血糖症、高血压症并称“三高”，对人体的危害非常大。一般情况 下如果你感到头晕、头疼、失眠、胸闷气短、记忆力下降、注意力不 集中、健忘或体形偏胖、四肢沉重或肢体麻木，都是高脂血症的前 兆。大量研究资料表明，高脂血症是脑卒中、冠心病、心肌梗死、心 脏猝死独立而重要的危险因素。\n　　此外，高脂血症还可导致脂肪肝、肝硬化、胆石症、胰腺炎、眼 底出血、失明、周围血管疾病、跛行、高尿酸血症。有些原发性和家 族性高脂血症病人还可出现腱状、结节状、掌平面及眼眶周围黄色 瘤、青年角膜弓等。\n　　　当血清总胆固醇高于 缘援苑圆毫摩尔辕升（圆园毫克辕分升）时，随
