物，又可以在体内合成，并提供我们新陈代谢时所消耗的能量。\n　　血液中的脂肪类物质（简称“脂质”）统称为“血脂”。血浆中 的脂类包括胆固醇（栽悦，也称总“胆固醇”）、三酰甘油（栽郧）、磷脂 和非游离脂肪酸等，其中胆固醇又主要以低密度脂蛋白（蕴阅蕴，占 总胆固醇的 苑缘豫）和高密度脂蛋白（匀阅蕴，占总胆固醇的 圆缘豫）的 形式存在。它们在血液中是与不同的蛋白质结合在一起，以“脂 蛋白“的形式存在。\n　　胆固醇和磷脂是细胞膜的组成部分，如果把细胞膜比喻为房 子，那么胆固醇就是房子的支柱和墙壁，而磷脂则相当于房子的 窗户。\n　　　有人认为胆固醇是无益的物质，这是没有道理的。人体内有 员园～员圆园克的胆固醇，它不但可以生产出无数个细胞，而且还是 类固醇激素和胆汁酸的原料。\n　　磷脂不仅仅是身体的构成成分，而且是葡萄糖、电解质、二氧 化碳等物质出入机体的窗口，在体内起着相当重要的作用。\n◆                                                                                                  摇○员摇\n\n\t 高脂血症防治      \n　　三酰甘油和脂肪酸是人体生存所必需的能源。如果把身体比 喻为一辆汽车的话，那么，脂肪酸则是用的汽油，而三酰甘油就是 储备的汽油。我们的皮下脂肪几乎全是三酰甘油。\n　　　可见，血脂本身对人体有益无害，而是多则为害；血脂不是可 有可无，而是必须有合适的血脂水平。血脂中某些成分过高或过 低将对人体产生“无声无息”的严重危害。\n摇摇圆援血脂的“来龙去脉”\n　　血液中脂质与蛋白质结合成为脂蛋白。低密度脂蛋白携带胆
