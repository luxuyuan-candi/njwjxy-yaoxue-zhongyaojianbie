高钾血症[256-257] 。CKD患者长期应用 ARB应定期监 测血钾和血肌酐水平 ,双侧肾动脉重度狭窄、妊娠妇 女、高钾血症者禁用。\n　　　(4)利尿剂 :利尿剂主要通过利钠排尿、降低容量 负荷而发挥降压作用 。噻嗪类利尿剂分为噻嗪型利尿 剂和噻嗪样利尿剂两种 ,前者包括氢氯噻嗪和苄氟噻 嗪等 ,后者包括吲达帕胺和氯噻酮等 。噻嗪样利尿剂 可通过 Na+ 、Ca2+ 交换机制减少小动脉平滑肌细胞内 钙含量 ,扩张小动脉 ,而且消除半衰期长于噻嗪型利尿 剂[258-259] 。在我国 , 常用于降压的噻嗪类利尿剂是氢 氯噻嗪和吲达帕胺。\n　　　优先推荐小剂量噻嗪类利尿剂与 ACEI或 ARB 联合 。噻嗪类利尿剂尤其适用于老年和盐敏感性高血\n\n\n压、ISH、伴心力衰竭 ,也是难治性高血压的基础药物 之一 。一般认为 eGFR<45 mL/(min · 1.73 m2 ) 的 患者应使用袢利尿剂降压。\n　　　噻嗪类利尿剂在预防心血管疾病和死亡风险方面 的有效性在 随 机 对 照 试 验 和 荟 萃 分 析 中 得 到 了 证 实[260-262] 。PATS研究证实吲达帕胺治疗可明显减少 脑卒中再发风险[225] 。利尿剂比较项目比较了噻嗪样 和噻嗪型利尿剂对高血压预后的改善效果 。其结果表 明两类药物在主要心血管不良结局方面没有明显差 异 ,但在有心肌梗死或脑卒中史的患者 ,氯噻酮组心脏 病和死亡的风险更低[263] 。\n　　　噻嗪类利尿剂的代谢不良反应与剂量密切相关 , 故通常应采用小剂量 。长期应用者应监测血钾 ,高尿 酸血症者慎用 ,痛风者禁用。\n　　保钾利尿药阿米洛利 ,促进尿钠排泄但抗高血压  活性较弱 ,与噻嗪类合用有协同降压作用(如复方阿米  洛利) ;也可用于治疗 Liddle综合征 。该药与 ACEI 或 ARB合用时需注意发生高钾血症的危险 。氨苯蝶  啶的保钾作用弱于阿米洛利 , 由于低剂量噻嗪类不易  引起低血钾 ,故现已很少联合使用。\n　　　(5)β受体阻滞剂 :主要通过抑制过度激活的交感  神经活性、抑制心肌收缩力、减慢心率发挥降压作用。 β受体阻滞剂分为 3种亚型 :非选择性 β受体阻\n######################\nOutput:", "role":
