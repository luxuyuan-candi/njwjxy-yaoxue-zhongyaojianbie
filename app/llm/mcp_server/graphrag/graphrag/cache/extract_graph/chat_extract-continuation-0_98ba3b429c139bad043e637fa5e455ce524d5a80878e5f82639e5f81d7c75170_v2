经系统同时有一定的保护作用，血尿酸水平过低则  有可能增加神经退行性疾病发生的风险。\n二、辅助检查\n（一）常规检查\n　　包括血尿常规、肝肾功能、血糖、血脂、红细胞 沉降率、C反应蛋白及泌尿系超声检查等 。痛风急 性发作期，多数患者红细胞沉降率和 C反应蛋白升 高 。慢性尿酸盐肾病时，尿常规示低比重尿、小分 子蛋白尿、白细胞尿、轻度血尿及管型尿 。此外，应 根据患者的器官受累情况进行其他相应的辅助 检查。\n（二）血尿酸测定\n　　　正常嘌呤饮食状态下，非同日两次空腹检测血  尿 酸 >420 μmol/L（7 mg/dl）时 ，诊 断 高 尿 酸 血 症 。 由于血尿酸受多种因素影响会有波动 ，应多次  测定。\n（三）尿尿酸测定\n　　　检测 24 h尿液中尿酸总量 。正常饮食情况下， 24 h 尿尿酸排泄量小于 800 mg 为肾脏尿酸排泄减  少，但该项检查目前不作为常规检查。\n（四）HLA?B*5801基因检测\n　　　HLA?B*5801 基因阳性与别嘌醇严重不良反 应，如 Steven?Johnson 或中毒性表皮坏死松解症等 重症药疹密切相关 。我国人群中 HLA?B*5801 基 因 阳 性 率 为 11.51%，以 华 南 地 区 最 高 ，可 达 20.19%。在有条件的地区应用别嘌醇前应进行基 因检测，以减少严重药物不良反应的发生。\n（五）影像学\n　　　1. 关节 X线片可见由于 MSU 晶体沉积导致的 关节软骨下骨质破坏，表现为偏心性圆形或卵圆形 囊性变，甚至呈虫噬样、穿凿样缺损，骨缺损边缘可 呈悬挂边缘征 。晚期可出现关节间隙明显变窄甚 至消失，形成纤维性强直，亦可出现关节半脱位或 脱位，甚至病理性骨折。\n　　　2. 超声对疑诊痛风性关节炎或慢性痛风石关 节炎患者的诊断更有意义 。最重要的四种超声征 象是痛风石、聚集物（关节积液内聚集的点状高回 声，后方不伴声影，又称暴风雪征）、软骨表面的双 轨征（double contour，DC）和骨侵蚀，其中双轨征是 尿酸沉积在关节内特异性很高的表现，其诊断痛风 性关节炎的敏感度为 78%，特异度为 97%。\n\n\n　　　3. 双能 CT：能特异性识别尿酸盐结晶，诊断痛 风 的
