,但常为多种机制并存 ,如肾血管性病变、肾 实质性病变、药物性高血压等 。针对不同于一般高血 压人群的降压治疗方案简介如下。\n　8.12.1  弥漫性毒性甲状腺肿   此类高血压的特点为 收缩压升高 ,舒张压降低 ,脉压增大[651] 。原则上应积 极治疗原发病 ,一旦甲状腺功能亢进症状得到控制后 , 血压也会逐渐恢复正常 ,可配合降压药治疗 。初始降 压药首选非选择性 β受体阻滞剂 ,其可阻断甲状腺激素 过量和肾素释放的外周表现 ,减少震颤和心动过速[652] 。\n　8.12.2  系统性红斑狼疮   新诊断无明显靶器官受损  的系统性红斑狼疮患者降压目标为140/90mmHg;狼  疮肾炎或糖尿病患者降压目标为 130/80mmHg[653] 。 治疗原则为积极控制原发病 ,合理调整免疫药剂量 ,治  疗所有相关心血管危险因素包括吸烟以及血糖、血脂  异常 ,正确管理高血压介导的器官损害[654] 。首选降  压药为 ACEI或 ARB[655] 。\n　8.12.3  类风湿关节炎   原则上类风湿性关节炎的降 压治疗遵循一般人群建议 。调整生活方式 ;严格和持 续控制类风湿性关节炎疾病活动 ;对于长期治疗 ,糖皮 质激素的剂量应保持在最低限度 ,并尝试减量[656] 。\n　8.12.4  系统性硬化症   系统性硬化症发生的高血压 主要见于硬皮病肾危象 , 以发展为急进性高血压和急 性肾损伤为特征 ,50%的患者可出现微血管病性溶血\n\n\n性贫血 ,通常伴头痛、乏力、高血压性视网膜病变、高血 压脑病、肺水肿和心功能不全等。\n　　应早期识别硬皮病肾危象 ,及时给予 ACEI治疗。 抗高血压治疗的目标是 24h 内收缩压下降 20mmHg,  舒张压下降 10mmHg,72h 内降至正常 。如 ACEI单  药降压不能达标 ,应联合 CCB和利尿剂 。β受体阻滞  剂可能会加重系统性硬化症的雷诺现象 ,故应避免使用。 对严重的微血管性溶血性贫血 ,可应用血浆置换[657] 。\n　8.12.5  免疫药引起的高血压   治疗原则是控制钠盐 摄入 ,尽量减少该类药物的给药剂量 。对于糖皮质激 素所致高血压可口服利尿剂、CCB、ACEI/ARB。传统\n######################\nOutput:",
