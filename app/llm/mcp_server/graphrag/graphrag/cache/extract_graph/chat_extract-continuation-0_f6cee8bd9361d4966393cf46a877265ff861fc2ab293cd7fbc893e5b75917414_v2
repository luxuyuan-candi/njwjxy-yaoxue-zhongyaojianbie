的胆固醇，把红细胞、白细胞等成分输回体内；二是选择性低密度\n远                                                    \n\n\n\n\n\t 六、高脂血症的治疗         \n　脂蛋白去除法，比较复杂，要在换血机内安装一种特异性过滤器， 将血液过滤，达到降低胆固醇的效果。血浆净化治疗适用于血胆\n固醇升高非常显著者，不宜常规使用，其原因有：①每次疗效仅能\n　维持 员个月左右，病人需长期多次治疗；②费用很高，一般病人难 以承受；③多次治疗可能会导致感染，尤其是病毒性肝炎、艾滋病 等问题防不胜防；④一般医疗单位没有能力购买这种机器，故血浆 净化治疗只能作为药物治疗的一种补充。\n　　至于高脂血症的手术治疗主要适用于那些家族性高胆固醇血 症病人。手术方式有 猿种：①部分回肠切除或空肠旁路手术减少 小肠吸收脂肪；②门腔静脉分流吻合，使胆固醇合成减少；③肝 移植。\n　　基因治疗目前正处于实验室阶段，如果能大量应用于临床，将 使众多高脂血症病人摆脱长期用药之苦。这些方法，主要是使血 中低密度脂蛋 白水平降低，因低密度脂蛋白重量的 缘园豫
