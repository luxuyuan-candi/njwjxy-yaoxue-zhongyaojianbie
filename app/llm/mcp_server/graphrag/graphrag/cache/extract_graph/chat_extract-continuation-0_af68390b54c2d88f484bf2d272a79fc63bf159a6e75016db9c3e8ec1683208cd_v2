这两者与动脉粥样硬化的发生密切相关，一旦联手，病人发生心脑 血管疾病的危险性将大大增加。\n　　（圆）糖尿病摇大部分糖尿病病人伴有继发性高脂血症。员型 糖尿病病人常出现低密度脂蛋白代谢紊乱，圆型糖尿病病人伴有 高脂血症更为常见，可能与病人肥胖，缺少运动，进食较多高饱和 脂肪酸、高胆固醇食物，吸烟，饮酒等有关。这类病人中高三酰甘 油血症较高胆固醇血症更为多见，由于其发生冠心病的危险较高， 应引起高度重视。\n　　（猿）脂肪肝摇高脂血症可以引起脂肪肝。因为肝脏与脂质物 质的代谢密切相关，它可使脂肪的消化吸收、氧化、转化以及分泌 等过程保持动态平衡。凡由于各种原因使脂肪代谢功能发生障 碍，致使脂类物质的动态平衡失调，脂肪在肝细胞内大量堆积，就 会引起脂肪肝。高脂血症病人由于营养过剩，致使肝细胞内堆积 脂肪、胆固醇、三酰甘油或磷脂，一般病人可以毫无症状，往往在体 检时发现有脂肪肝，中、重度脂肪肝可有明显症状，如肝区不适等。\n                                                     \n\n\n\n\n\t 三、高脂血症的“危险伙伴”         \n目前，脂肪肝的诊断主要靠腹部 月超检查。\n　　（源）饮酒与吸烟摇酒中含有乙醇，对血脂代谢可产生一系列 影响。很多研究发现，嗜酒者血清总胆固醇、三酰甘油、低密度脂 蛋白均会明显升高，尤其是后两者，而且这些病人患高血压、脑卒 中和肝硬化的危险性也大大增加。\n吸烟是冠心病、心肌梗死的重要危险因素，更是血脂代谢障碍\n的影响因素，吸烟者血清三酰甘油含量通常比不吸烟者高 员园豫\n员缘豫。如吸烟者同时伴有高脂血症和高血压，则冠心病的发病率 可增加 怨～员圆倍。开始吸烟的年龄越早，每天吸烟支数越多，烟吸 入肺部越深，则危险性越大。\n　　（缘）冠心病摇这是人们最关心的问题，因为冠心病可以发生 心绞痛、心肌梗死甚至猝死。肯定地说，无论胆固醇增高，还是三 酰甘油增高，都是冠心病的主要危险因素，\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
