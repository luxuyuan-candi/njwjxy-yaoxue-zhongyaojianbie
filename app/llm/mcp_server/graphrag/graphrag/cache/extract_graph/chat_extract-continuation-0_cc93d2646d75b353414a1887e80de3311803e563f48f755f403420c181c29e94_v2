Beijing 100044,China,Email:dayi.hu@china-heart.org\n\n\n一、概述\n(一)定义\n　　　高血压定义：未使用降压药物的情况下，非同 日3次测量诊室血压，收缩压(SBP)≥140  mmHg   (1mmHg=0.133 kPa)和/或舒张压(DBP)≥90 mmHg。 SBP≥140 mmHg和DBP<90 mmHg为单纯性收缩期 高血压。患者既往有高血压史，目前正在使用降压 药物，血压虽低于140/90 mmHg, 仍应诊断为高 血压 。\n(二)分类\n　　　根据血压升高水平，进一步将高血压分为 1级、2级和3级!。血压水平分类和定义见表1。\n表 1 血压水平分类和定义(mmHg)\n\n分类\t收缩压\t\t舒张压\n正常血压\t<120\t和\t<80\n正常高值\t120~139\t和/或\t80~89\n高血压\t≥140\t和/或\t≥90\n1级高血压(轻度)\t140~159\t和/或\t90~99\n2级高血压(中度)\t160~179\t和/或\t100~109\n3级高血压(重度)\t≥180\t和/或\t≥110\n单纯收缩期高血压\t≥140\t和\t<90\n　　注：当收缩压和舒张压分属不同级别时，以较高分级为准； 1mmHg=0.133kPa\n(三)流行病学\n　　　中国高血压调查最新数据显示2,2012—2015年 我国18岁及以上居民高血压患病粗率为27.9%(标 化率23.2%),与既往调查比较，患病率总体呈增高 趋势。18岁及以上人群高血压的知晓率、治疗率\n\n\n和控制率分别为51.5%,46.1%和16.9%,较1991年 和2002年明显增高。\n　　血压水平与心血管风险呈连续、独立、直接的 正相关关系。卒中仍是目前我国高血压人群最主 要的并发症，冠心病事件也明显增多，其他并发症 包括心力衰竭、左心室肥厚、心房颤动、终末期 肾 病 3 。\n二、病因学\n　　高钠、低钾膳食，超重与肥胖，过量饮酒和长期  精神紧张是我国人群重要的高血压发病危险因素， 其中高钠、低钾\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>中华医学会<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chinese Medical Association, a professional organization involved in
