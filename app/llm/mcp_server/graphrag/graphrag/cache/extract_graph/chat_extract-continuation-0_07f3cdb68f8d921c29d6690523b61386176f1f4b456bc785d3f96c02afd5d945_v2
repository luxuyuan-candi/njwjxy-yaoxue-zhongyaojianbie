素，长期患高脂血症可导致动脉粥样硬化，增加心血管疾病 的发病率和死亡率。\n　　　　高脂血症危险因素多与不合理膳食相关，如过量的饱和   脂肪酸或反式脂肪酸摄入等。健康生活方式干预是全球公认   的高脂血症防治策略。膳食营养通过调节血脂、血压或血糖   水平等危险因素，影响动脉粥样硬化的发生，从而在预防高   脂血症引起的心血管疾病中发挥重要作用。以“辨证施膳” 为核心的中医食养是在中医辨证施治理论基础上的非药物   调养方法，强调根据体质、病因、证候给予不同食养方案，  在调和气血、平衡人体营养、辅助预\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
