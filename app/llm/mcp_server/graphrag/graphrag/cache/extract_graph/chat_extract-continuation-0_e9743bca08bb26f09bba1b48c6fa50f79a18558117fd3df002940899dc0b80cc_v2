高血压和血脂异常共管需双达标\n　　心脑血管疾病的延伸，通常是由高血压作为基 础疾病引起。当血压及血脂 4 项的指标过高，这两 类疾病将共同驱动 ASCVD 的疾病进展，患有心脑 血管疾病的患者，通常不能只是按照某一危险因素 的严重程度去评估整个疾病进展的程度，应同时考 虑多个危险因素的数量。两病并存的患者，分析血 压指标及其并发的危险因素有助于判断整个系统疾 病的进展程度，因此决定降低血压及以 LDL-C 为主 的血脂指标，双达标目的是控制 ASCVD 的关键。\n\n\n\n2025 年第 1 期    第 22 卷     11   \n\n\n 标准与讨论\n\n\n表 7  高血压和血脂异常共病患者血压、血脂控制目标\n\n患者分类\t血压控制指标 a （mmHg）\tLDL-C 目标值 b （mmol/L）\t非 HDL-C 目标值 c
