降脂治疗的策略\n降脂治疗包括生活方式干预和药物治疗。\n　　首先推荐健康生活方式，包括合理膳食、适度增加 身体活动、控制体质量、戒烟和限制饮酒等。其中合理 膳食对血脂影响较大，主要是限制饱和脂肪酸及反式脂 肪酸的摄入，增加蔬菜和水果、全谷物、膳食纤维及鱼 类的摄入。对 ASCVD 中危以上人群或合并高胆固醇血 症患者，应特别强调减少膳食胆固醇的摄入，每天膳食 胆固醇摄入量应在 300 mg 以下［11-13］。血脂管理膳食治 疗建议如下。\n　\n\n　　在无 ASCVD 的人群中，当生活方式干预 3 个月后 不能达到降脂目标时，应考虑加用降脂药物。他汀类 药物是降胆固醇治疗的基础，推荐起始使用常规剂量 或中等强度他汀类药物。当 LDL-C 不能达标时，可联 合使用非他汀类降脂药物，如胆固醇吸收抑制剂［15］\n\n\n或 / 和前蛋白转化酶枯草溶菌素 9（proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9，PCSK9）抑制剂［10］。\n　　对于 ASCVD 超高危患者， 当基线 LDL-C 较高（未 使用他汀类药物患者 LDL-C ≥ 4.9 mmol/L，或服用他 汀类药物患者 LDL-C ≥ 2.6 mmol/L），预计他汀类药 物联合胆固醇吸收抑制剂不能使 LDL-C 达标时，可考 虑直接联用他汀类药物和 PCSK9 抑制剂，以保证患者 LDL-C 早期达标。\n降脂策略流程见图 2。\n\n根据 ASCVD 危险分层确定目标水平\n　　　　\n\n高危及以上\n\n\n生活方式干预\n未达标\n\n常规剂量或中等强度他汀类药物\n基线 LDL-C 水平较高且 预 计 经 他汀 类 药 物 联 合 胆 固 醇 吸收 抑 制 剂 干 预 难以达标的超高危患者\n\n加用 PCSK9 抑制剂\n注：PCSK9=
