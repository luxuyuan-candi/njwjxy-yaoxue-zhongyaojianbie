65.8岁），结果显示混合型高脂血症患病 率为 10.2%［混合型高脂血症的诊断标准中，TG≥ \t1.7 mmol/L（ 150 mg/dl），LDL?C 升高则是依据不同 心血管疾病风险等级而定］［13］。\n二、发病机制\n　　　根据病因混合型高脂血症可分为原发性和继  发性 。原发性高脂血症主要是由基因突变引起，多  具有家族聚集性，遗传倾向明显 。多个与脂质代谢  相关的基因，如低密度脂蛋白受体（LDL?R）基因、 载脂蛋白（Apo）基因（ApoA、ApoB、ApoC、ApoE）以  及脂蛋白脂酶（lipoprotein lipase，LPL）基因等，均参  与调控血脂生成及其代谢［14］，这些基因功能缺失型  突变，会增加个体发生高脂血症风险，而后天不健  康的生活方式，如高脂饮食、吸烟、过量饮酒、缺乏  运动，则加重血脂异常水平 。继发性高脂血症是由  于其他疾病导致的血脂异常，影响血脂合成和代谢  的疾病均可导致血脂异常 。血脂来源有 2条途径， 包括膳食脂肪摄入和肝脏内源性合成 。过量摄入  脂肪是血脂水平升高的危险因素之一，摄入富含胆  固醇和饱和脂肪酸的饮食会引起胆固醇升高［15］。 肝脏在血脂代谢中发挥着关键作用，其功能障碍可  能引起甘油三酯和胆固醇水平升高［16］，这在肝硬化  和病毒性肝炎等肝脏疾病中尤为常见 。胰岛素抵  抗是混合型高脂血症的另一个常见原因［17］，其通过  增强脂肪组织中激素敏感脂肪酶活性，促进甘油三\n酯分解，释放游离脂肪酸，从而导致血脂水平升高。\n\n\n此外，胰岛素抵抗还能通过增加肝脏极低密度脂蛋  白（very low density lipoprotein，VLDL）生成和抑制  LDL?R表达，干扰血脂正常代谢［18］。糖尿病、肥胖、 甲状腺功能减退、多囊卵巢等患者均存在胰岛素抵  抗，因此他们也常合并混合型高脂血症 。此外，某  些药物，包括噻嗪类利尿剂 、β 受体阻滞剂 、雌激  素?黄体酮避孕药和抗逆转录病毒药物等，也可能  导致血脂异常。\n三、定义、诊断与评估\n（一）定义、诊断标准\n　　混合\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
