脂肪如牛油、奶酪、猪油、动物内脏等等。但是，认为凡是吃动物油 都不好，应该多吃植物油的说法也是不全面的，动物油中鱼油却是 例外，适当吃鱼油具有预防动脉粥样硬化的作用。植物油中如椰 子油、橄榄油对提高胆固醇的作用也不亚于某些动物油，也应少吃 为好。至于降脂药（确切的应称为调脂药）应仅用于饮食仍不能

心血管病与非癌症死亡的疾病（包括呼吸道和消化道及非疾病原 因如创伤、车祸等）死亡率随血浆中胆固醇水平的升高而减低，也 就是说血浆胆固醇水平越低，这类疾病的死亡率也就越高。科学 实验表明，体内血胆固醇水平过低的人，患结肠癌的概率是胆固醇 水平较高的人的 猿倍。胆固醇过低还会造成机体功能紊乱、免疫 功能下降、精神状态不稳、血管壁变脆、脑出血的危险性增加等。 日本东京大学研究人员还提出一种新观点，认为吃高胆固醇食品 对老年人反而有益。 员园年的研究发现，胆固醇含量丰富的食品能 降低那些与动脉硬化和心血管疾病有关的“坏”胆固醇（低密度脂\n
