当检测结果满足\n①+③或②+③时，可诊断为混合型高脂血症［6］。\n（二）血脂异常筛查\n　　　血脂异常的早期识别和持续监测对于 ASCVD 预防和治疗至关重要［6?19］。我国成人血脂异常患病 率持续升高，然而我国居民血脂异常检出率、知晓 率仍较低［6］，提高公众对定期血脂检测的认知是预 防 ASCVD 的关键 。建议将血脂检测纳入全人群常 规体检项目，包括儿童和青少年。\n　　　血脂检测项目主要包括 TC、LDL?C、HDL?C 和 TG。筛查策略建议如下：①20~40岁的成年人应至 少每 5 年检测 1 次血脂；②≥40 岁的成年人应每年 检测 1 次血脂；③ASCVD 患者及其高危人群应每 3~6个月检测 1次血脂；④因 ASCVD住院患者应在 入院时或入院 24 h 内检测血脂；⑤上述人群应至少 检测 1次脂蛋白（a）［Lp（a）］［6，19］。\n　　　重点筛查对象：① 既往诊断 ASCVD 的患者 ； ②具有多个 ASCVD 危险因素（包括高血压 、糖尿  病、吸烟、肥胖或超重、胰岛素抵抗、代谢相关脂肪  性肝病、慢性肾脏病等）的人群，此类人群容易合并  高 TG 血症，同时应重视检测 TG［20］；③有早发心血  管疾病家族史者（指男性一级直系亲属在 55 岁前  或女性一级直系亲属在 65岁前罹患缺血性心血管  疾病），或已知家族性高脂血症患者；④出现皮肤或  肌腱黄色瘤、跟腱增厚表现的患者［6，19，21］。\n（三）心血管疾病风险评估\n　　　心血管疾病风险评估是制定血脂管理策略的 前提和基础 。 国际上广泛采用的风险评估工具包 括欧洲血脂异常治疗指南提出的 SCORE心血管风 险量表、加拿大心血管预期寿命模型、冠状动脉钙\n\n\n\n中华全科医师杂志 2024 年 9
