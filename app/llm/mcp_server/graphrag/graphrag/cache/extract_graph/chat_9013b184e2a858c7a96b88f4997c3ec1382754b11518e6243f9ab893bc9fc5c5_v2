population in the world.Polypharmacy in the elderly with multiple diseases is inevitable and very common.In recent years，more and more medical and pharmaceutical experts appeal to pay attention to the risk of polypharmacy in elderly and put forward management to avoid damage caused by drug interaction in multi-drug combination therapy.To meet the needs of clinical practice and further to improve the level of drug safety in elderly ，a group of clinical medicine and pharmaceutical experts in China have worked out the “Expert Consensus on the Risk Management of Polypharmacy in Elderly”for clinical reference to ensure the safety of drug use.\n【Key words 】  Eldery；Polypharmacy；Risk management；Expert consensus\n\n\n　　我国是世界上老年人口最多的国家， 占全球老年人 口的 1/5 。21 世纪 20 年代至 40
