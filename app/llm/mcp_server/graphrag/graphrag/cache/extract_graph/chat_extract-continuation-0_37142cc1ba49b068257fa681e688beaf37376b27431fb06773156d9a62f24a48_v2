。降压治疗能显著降低糖尿病患者大血管事  件和死亡风险 ,预防肾病和视网膜病变等微血管并发  症 ,收缩压每下降 10mmHg,死亡风险下降 13% ,心  血管风险下降 11% ,视网膜病变风险下降 13%[601] 。 强化降压治疗对 2型糖尿病患者获益更多 ,全因死亡  和主要心血管事件风险分别降低 18% ,心肌梗死风险  降低 14% ,脑卒中风险降低 28%[602] 。\n　8.7.1   降压目标   一般糖尿病患者的血压控制目标 为<130/80mmHg[603-604] ;针对老年或伴严重冠心病 的糖尿病患者 ,可设定相对宽松的血压控制目标值 ,可 放宽至 140/90mmHg。对于合并糖尿病的孕妇 , 建 议血压控制目标为≤135/85mmHg,以降低母体高血 压加 速 进 展 的 风 险 , 并 尽 量 减 少 对 胎 儿 生 长 的 影 响[336] 。\n　8.7.2   降压治疗   生活方式干预对于 2 型糖尿病患 者非常重要 。应特别强调针对超重和肥胖的干预措 施 , 以改善血糖和代谢异常。\n　　　降压药选择应综合考虑降压疗效、靶器官保护作  用、患者依从性 , 以及药物安全性和对代谢的影响等因  素 。常用降压药均可用于糖尿病合并高血压的治疗。 合并白蛋白尿或 CKD的糖尿病患者 ,应首选 ACEI或  ARB[605] 。糖尿病患者通常需要 2种或 2种以上的降  压药联合治疗 。联合用药时 ,应以 ACEI或 ARB为基  础 ,联合 CCB、小剂量利尿剂或选择性 β受体阻滞剂。 联合用药方案优先推荐 SPC,其在疗效、依从性和安  全性方面优于上述药物的自由联合[606] 。糖尿病患者  一般不推荐 ACEI联合 ARB以及利尿剂联合选择性\n\n\n　β受体阻滞剂 。糖尿病合并高尿酸血症者慎用利尿 剂 。反复低血糖发作者慎用 β受体阻滞剂 , 以免掩盖 低血糖症状 。如需应用利尿剂和 β受体阻滞剂 ,宜小 剂量使用 。有前列腺肥大且血压控制不佳的患者可使 用 α受体阻滞剂 。对糖尿病合并难治性高血压的患 者 ,可在 3种降压药联用的基础上 ,加用螺内酯。\n　　新型降糖药 SGLT2i和 GLP-1RA可能有助于改
