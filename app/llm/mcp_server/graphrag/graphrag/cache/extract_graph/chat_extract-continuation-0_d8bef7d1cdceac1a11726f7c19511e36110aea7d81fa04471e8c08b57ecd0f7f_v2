病的主要危险因子之一，其主要特征是血管内压持续 升高，导致血管壁负担加重，并引发内皮功能障碍。 而高血脂，特别是 LDL-C 升高与 HDL-C 减少，促进了 血管壁脂质沉积，诱发动脉粥样硬化。两者的叠加效 应，使得血管系统遭受双重冲击，心血管事件的发生 风险显著增高。高血压在导致血管壁张力增大、损伤 内皮细胞的同时，往往伴随有血液流变学改变，如血 黏度升高、血小板聚集增多等现象。这些改变为动脉\n\n\n　硬化的发生提供了有利条件，而血脂异常则进一步加 速了这一过程。高水平的胆固醇，尤其是低密度脂蛋 白胆固醇，作为主要的致动脉粥样硬化因子，沉积在 血管壁中，形成脂质斑块，逐渐引起动脉管腔狭窄、 血流受阻，最终可能导致心脏缺血、冠状动脉事件等 严重后果。更为严重的是，高血压与高血脂的合并常 常引发一系列“相互助长 ”的病理机制。例如，高血 压的存在可加剧血管内皮损伤，进而加快动脉硬化的 进程。而血脂异常则通过改变脂质代谢与脂质斑块的 稳定性，增加了斑块破裂、血栓形成的可能性，这为 心肌梗死、\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
