The  expert  consensus  and guidelines related to these conditions primarily focus on clinical diagnosis and treatment. However, there are few guidelines addressing the integration of prevention and treatment, hierarchic healthcare, interdepartmental collaboration, and standardized management within primary healthcare in China. Currently, the implementation of medical and preventive integration for coexisting hypertension and dyslipidemia in primary healthcare in China has not yielded the anticipated results. To enhance the guidance and standardization of integrated medical and preventive management for coexisting hypertension and dyslipidemia at primary healthcare in China, we convened a group of experts to develop a consensus on standardized management. This consensus is based on an in-depth analysis of literature, extensive collection of suggestions, and practical evidence, encompassing the following aspects, background and philosophy, diagnostic criteria, management processes, organizational responsibilities and team\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chinese Hospital Association is involved in the expert consensus on standardized management for medical and preventive integration of coexisting hypertension and dyslipidemia in primary health care\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE ANTI - AGING PROMOTION ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chinese Anti - Aging Promotion Association contributes to the expert consensus on standardized management for medical and preventive integration of coexisting hypertension and dyslipidemia in primary health care\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHINESE MEDICINE EDUCATION ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Chinese Medicine Education Association is part of the expert consensus on standardized management for medical and preventive integration of coexisting hypertension and dyslipidemia in primary health care\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUANGDONG GRASS - ROOTS HEALTH ASSOCIATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Guangdong Grass - roots Health Association is involved in the expert consensus on standardized management for medical and preventive integration of coexisting hypertension and dyslipidemia in primary health care\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ZHOU ZHIHENG<|>PERSON<|>Zhou Zhiheng is an associate professor at Southern Medical University Pingshan Hospital, specializing in chronic disease health management, and the corresponding author of the expert consensus\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOUTHERN MEDICAL UNIVERSITY PINGSHAN HOSPITAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Southern Medical University Pingshan Hospital is the institution where Zhou Zhiheng works, focusing on chronic disease health management\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXPERT CONSENSUS ON STANDARDIZED MANAGEMENT FOR MEDICAL AND PREVENTIVE INTEGRATION OF COEXISTING HYPERTENSION AND DYSLIPIDEMIA IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE<|>EVENT<|>This expert consensus aims to provide guidelines for the standardized management of coexisting hypertension and dyslipidemia in primary health care in China\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZHOU ZHIHENG<|>SOUTHERN MEDICAL UNIVERSITY PINGSHAN HOSPITAL<|>Zhou Zhiheng is an associate professor at Southern Medical University Pingshan Hospital<|>8\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ZHOU ZHIHENG<|>EXPERT CONSENSUS ON STANDARDIZED MANAGEMENT FOR MEDICAL AND PREVENTIVE INTEGRATION OF COEXISTING HYPERTENSION AND DYSLIPIDEMIA IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE<|>Zhou Zhiheng is the corresponding author of the expert consensus<|>7\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION<|>EXPERT CONSENSUS ON STANDARDIZED MANAGEMENT FOR MEDICAL AND PREVENTIVE INTEGRATION OF COEXISTING HYPERTENSION AND DYSLIPIDEMIA IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE<|>Chinese Hospital Association is involved in the development of the expert consensus<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE ANTI - AGING PROMOTION ASSOCIATION<|>EXPERT CONSENSUS ON STANDARDIZED MANAGEMENT FOR MEDICAL AND PREVENTIVE INTEGRATION OF COEXISTING HYPERTENSION AND DYSLIPIDEMIA IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE<|>Chinese Anti - Aging Promotion Association contributes to the expert consensus<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHINESE MEDICINE EDUCATION ASSOCIATION<|>EXPERT CONSENSUS ON STANDARDIZED MANAGEMENT FOR MEDICAL AND PREVENTIVE INTEGRATION OF COEXISTING HYPERTENSION AND DYSLIPIDEMIA IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE<|>Chinese Medicine Education Association is part of the expert consensus<|>6\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUANGDONG GRASS - ROOTS HEALTH ASSOCIATION<|>EXPERT CONSENSUS ON STANDARDIZED MANAGEMENT FOR MEDICAL AND PREVENTIVE INTEGRATION OF COEXISTING HYPERTENSION AND DYSLIPIDEMIA IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE<|>Guangdong Grass - roots Health Association is involved in the expert consensus<|>6\")\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
