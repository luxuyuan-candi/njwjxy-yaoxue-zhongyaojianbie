The diagnostic criteria for hypertension via HBPM is an average SBP ≥135 mmHg and/or DBP ≥85 mmHg. HBPM can be self-measured by the patient or assisted by family members, also known as self-measured or home blood pressure measurement. HBPM helps enhance patient health awareness, improve treatment adherence, and is suitable for long-term blood pressure monitoring. With advancements in telemetry technology and devices, internet-based remote home blood pressure monitoring and management may become a new model for future blood pressure management, though more research is needed to validate its effectiveness and health economics.
