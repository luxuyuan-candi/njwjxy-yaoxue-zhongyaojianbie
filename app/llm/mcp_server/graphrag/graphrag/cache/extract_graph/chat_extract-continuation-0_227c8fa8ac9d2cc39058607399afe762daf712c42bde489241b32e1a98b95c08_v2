升高与不健康生活方式及饮食密切相关，运动 和控制饮食可有效降低 TG。饮酒是 TG 升高的非常重 要的因素，TG 升高的个体更需要严格限制酒精摄入。 饮食成分中除限制饱和脂肪酸的摄入外，要特别注意减 少精制碳水化合物摄入，增加膳食纤维含量丰富的低糖 饮食如全谷类的粗粮摄入。\n　　降低 TG 的药物主要包括贝特类、ω-3 多不饱和脂 肪酸(ω-3 脂肪酸，指高纯度医用处方级）及烟酸类 药物，具体用法如下。\n　\n3.5    降脂治疗过程的监测与随访\n　　降脂治疗中监测的目的：（1）观察是否达到降脂  目标值；（2）了解药物的潜在不良反应。根据评估结果， 优化药物治疗方案，不建议轻易停药。\n　　降脂治疗随访时间：开始药物治疗后 4~6 周随访 1 次，安全达标后 3~6 个月随访 1 次（图 3）。\n　\nv3~6 个月\n\t复查血脂水平  \n\n　\n6 个月

史者；\n　　（3）降脂治疗后血脂不能达标，或有严重药物不 良反应者。\n4    降脂药物治疗\n　　根据其主要作用，降脂药物分为主要降低胆固醇的  药物和主要降低 TG 的药物。在临床实践中通常根据血  脂异常类型、基线血脂水平以及需要达到的血脂目标值， 决定是否启用降脂药物或是否联合应用。\n4.1    主要降胆固醇药物\n　　主要降胆固醇药物包括他汀类药物、胆固醇吸收抑 制剂、PCSK9 抑制剂、普罗布考及其他降脂药。\n4.1.1   他汀类药物适用于高胆固醇血症、混合型高脂血 症和 ASCVD 的防治。他汀类药物还可使 TG 水平降低 7%~30%，HDL-C 水平升高 5%~15%。不同种类与剂量 的他汀类药\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
