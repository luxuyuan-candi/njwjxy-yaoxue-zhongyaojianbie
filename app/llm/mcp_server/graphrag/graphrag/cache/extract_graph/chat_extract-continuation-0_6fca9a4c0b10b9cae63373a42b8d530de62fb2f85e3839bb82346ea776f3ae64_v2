大脑的作用，就更加引起人们的注意。\n　　　另外，鱼中含有丰富的被称做牛磺酸的氨基酸，这种牛磺酸有 助于在肝脏内把胆固醇分解为胆汁酸，可预防胆固醇增高。当然， 要注意挑选新鲜的鱼吃。\n水产品中的 w鄄猿脂肪酸主要在鱼油中，特别是寒带、深水的鱼\n　和鲑鱼、青花鱼、鲥鱼、沙甸鱼。鱼油的 w鄄猿脂肪酸含量比植物油 高 员～源倍。原来血液中的脂肪和脂质不能独立地在血液中循环， 须与一种蛋白结合，这种蛋白称为脂蛋自。脂蛋白分为高密度的 高密度脂蛋白和低密度的低密度脂蛋白。高密度脂蛋白将脂质运 输到肝脏进行分解代谢；低密度脂蛋白则将脂质运输到全身各组 织贮存。鱼油使高密度脂蛋白含量增高，低密度脂蛋白含量下降。\n　　　一般降低血脂药物主要是促使三酰甘油和胆固醇的分解代 谢，对肝、肾脏有毒性，鱼油则没有毒性。\n◆
