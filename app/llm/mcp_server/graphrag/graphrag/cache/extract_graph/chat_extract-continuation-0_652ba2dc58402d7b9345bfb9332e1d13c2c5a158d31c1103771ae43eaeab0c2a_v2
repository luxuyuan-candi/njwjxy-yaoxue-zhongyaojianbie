肝癌免疫微环境的机制尚未完全阐明。\n　　8 月 13 日，浙江大学王青青研究团 队在期刊《Advanced Science》上发表了 研究论文。.研究人员建立了原位肝癌 小鼠模型，并使用不同剂量的黄连素进 行治疗。黄连素可有效降低肝癌小鼠 的肿瘤负荷。流式细胞术检测显示黄 连素治疗后肿瘤免疫格局的变化，揭示 了 T 淋巴细胞效应功能的增强。其中， 黄 连 素 降 低 了 TCRbhiPD- 1hiCD69 + CD27+效应性CD8+T淋巴细胞的比例，升 高了Ly6ChiTCRb+CD69+CD27+CD62L+中 央记忆性CD8+T淋巴细胞的比例。单细 胞 RNA 测序进一步阐明了黄连素对肝脏 免疫细胞转录谱的影响，并证实了肝癌 免疫微环境中 T 淋巴细胞的表型异质 性。黄连素可能通过调节细胞因子介 导的免疫细胞之间的受体-配体相互作 用来调节肝癌中的抗肿瘤免疫。这些 发现提高了对黄连素在预防肝细胞癌 方面的作用的理解。黄连素有望成为 一 种 抑 制 肝 癌 进 展 的 治 疗 策 略 。\n(小化)\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>浙江大学<|>organization<|>浙江大学 is a
