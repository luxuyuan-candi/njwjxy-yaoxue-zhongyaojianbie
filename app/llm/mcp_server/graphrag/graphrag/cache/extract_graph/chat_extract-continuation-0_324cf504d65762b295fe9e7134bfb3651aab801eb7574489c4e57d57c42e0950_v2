disease，CVD） 是 我 国 城 乡 居 民 第 一 位死亡原因，占死因构成的 40% 以上［1］ 。近年来，\n\n　\n\n\n\n·2430 · https://www.chinagp.net    E-mail: zgqkyx@chinagp.net.cn\n\n\n\tJuly 2024，Vol.27 No.20     Chinese General Practice \n\n\n\n　我国 ASCVD 的负担仍持续增加，防控形势严峻。目前 已证实， 低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（low-density lipoprotein cholesterol，LDL-C）是 ASCVD 的致病性危险因素［2］ 。 然而，资料显示，近年来我国≥ 18 岁人群血脂异常患 病率明显升高［3］ ，但其知晓率、治疗率和控制率均处 于较低水平。因此，有必要进一步加强血脂管理，做好 ASCVD 的一级和二级预防。\n　　2023-03-24，由国家心血管病专家委员会联合中华  医学会心血管病学分会、内分泌学分会、糖尿病学分会、 检验医学分会及中国卒中学会发布了《中国血脂管理指  南（2023 年）》［4］ 。为便于基层医生更好地开展血脂  管理，在该指南基础上，制定了《中国血脂管理指南（基  层版 2024 年）》。\n1    血脂检测项目\n　　建议临床血脂检测包括总胆固醇（total cholesterol， TC）、 甘 油 三 酯（triglyceride，TG）、LDL-C 和 高 密 度 脂 蛋 白 胆 固 醇（high-density lipoprotein cholesterol， HDL-C）。TC 是指血液中各脂蛋白所含胆固醇之总和。 LDL-C 是 ASCVD 的致病性危险因素，是调脂治疗的首 要干预靶点。通常情况下，HDL-C 水平与 ASCVD 风险 呈负相关。\n　　非 HDL-C 为 TC 减去 HDL-C 获得，代表了所有含 载脂蛋白 B（apolipoprotein B，ApoB）脂蛋白胆固醇的 总量，非 HDL-C 也可作为 ASCVD 一级和二级预防的 干预靶点。\n　　有条件的医疗机构可以开展 ApoA1、ApoB、脂蛋 白（a）［Lipoprotein（a），Lp（a）］检测。一般情况 下， 血清 ApoA1 主要反映高密度脂蛋白（high-density lipoprotein，HDL）颗粒水平，血清 ApoB 主要反映低密 度脂蛋白（low-density lipoprotein，LDL）颗粒水平。Lp （a） 由 LDL 样颗粒和 Apo（a）组成， 是 ASCVD 和钙 化性主动脉瓣狭窄的独立危险因素。\n2    血脂筛查对象\n　　血脂筛查有利于及早发现血脂异常人群和指导 ASCVD 风 险 评估 与 干 预 治 疗。 对 于 普 通 人 群， 建议 <40 岁成年人每 2~5 年进行\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content":
