The journal has also featured studies on blood pressure trajectories in the elderly, the relationship between blood pressure and stroke recurrence, and cumulative blood pressure exposure in young adulthood. Additionally, *Circulation* published research on pharmacological interventions, such as a 2009 study examining the effects of aliskiren, losartan, or both on left ventricular mass in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy.
