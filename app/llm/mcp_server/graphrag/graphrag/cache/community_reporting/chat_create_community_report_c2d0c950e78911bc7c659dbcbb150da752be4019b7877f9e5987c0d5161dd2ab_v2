It can be classified as **ischemic** (due to blocked blood vessels) or **hemorrhagic** (due to bleeding in the brain). Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a major risk factor for stroke, and controlling blood pressure through antihypertensive treatment is crucial for reducing both the risk of occurrence and recurrence.  \n\nStroke is also associated with other conditions, including **metabolic syndrome**, **high lipid levels**, **aortic stenosis** (due to altered cerebral hemodynamics), and **atrial fibrillation**, where anticoagulation therapies such as NOACs and warfarin are used to prevent stroke. Additionally, **folic acid therapy** (as demonstrated in the CSPPT trial) has been shown to help prevent stroke in certain populations.  \n\nBeyond its physiological causes, stroke is studied in relation to **depression** and is a leading cause of death, particularly in China, where it is the most common type of cardiovascular disease. Research on stroke and related conditions is published in dedicated scientific journals.  \n\nIn summary, stroke is a serious medical condition with multiple risk factors, complications, and preventive strategies, emphasizing the importance of blood pressure management and targeted therapies.\",27\n893,BLOOD PRESSURE,,10\n1533,RANKIN SCALE,\"A clinical scale used to measure disability and dependence in stroke patients\"\"\",1\n2180,MARKIDAN J,\"A researcher involved in a study on smoking and the risk of ischemic stroke in young men>\nResearcher who studied smoking and risk of ischemic stroke>\",1\n2181,COLE JW,\"A researcher involved in a study on smoking and the risk of ischemic stroke in young men>\nResearcher who studied smoking and risk of ischemic stroke>\",1\n2182,CRONIN CA,\"A researcher involved in a study on smoking and the risk of ischemic stroke in young men>\nResearcher who studied smoking and risk of ischemic stroke>\",1\n3312,中华医学会神经病学分会,\"The Chinese Medical Association's Neurology Branch, responsible for guidelines on stroke prevention and treatment\"\"\",1\n347,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,\"**Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)** is a cardiovascular condition characterized by the impairment of blood vessels supplying the heart muscle, often associated with high lipid levels in the blood. It is influenced by various factors, including metabolic syndrome, which increases its risk, and hypertension, with studies noting a rising prevalence among hypertensive patients. While CHD has a strong association with hypertension, this link is less pronounced than its association with stroke in the Chinese population. Dietary choices play a significant role in its development and management; reducing trans fatty acids and increasing unsaturated fats can help mitigate risk. Additionally, CHD-related events are closely tied to blood pressure levels, underscoring the importance of cardiovascular health monitoring and lifestyle modifications.  \n\nThis summary integrates all provided descriptions into a coherent overview of Coronary Heart Disease, resolving any minor contradictions by contextualizing the relationships between CHD, hypertension, diet, and population-specific trends.\",6\n1150,ISCHEMIC STROKE,\"**ISCHEMIC STROKE** is a type of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event characterized by blocked blood flow to the brain, typically due to arterial blockages. It is included in the ASCVD risk classification and represents a significant cerebrovascular condition. The risk of ischemic stroke may be heightened by factors such as hyperuricemia. For secondary prevention, a combination of diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) has been shown to be beneficial in managing the condition.

This tearing can lead to a separation (dissection) of the aortic wall layers, which may result in complications such as stenosis (narrowing of the artery) or life-threatening bleeding. The condition is frequently associated with high blood pressure, which exacerbates the risk of further tearing or rupture. Immediate medical intervention, including rapid and significant blood pressure reduction, is often required to stabilize the patient and prevent worsening of the dissection.
