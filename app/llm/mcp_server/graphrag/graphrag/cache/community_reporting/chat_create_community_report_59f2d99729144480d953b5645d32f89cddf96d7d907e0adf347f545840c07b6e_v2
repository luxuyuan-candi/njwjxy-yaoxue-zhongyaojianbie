It encompasses a variety of activities, including walking, running, swimming, and other endurance-based exercises that increase heart rate and improve oxygen circulation throughout the body. These exercises are beneficial for individuals of all ages, including elderly populations, who may engage in gentler forms such as tai chi, qigong, or low-impact jogging to maintain fitness and overall well-being.  \n\nAerobic exercise is particularly effective for promoting heart health, as it strengthens the cardiovascular system, improves circulation, and aids in the regulation of key health markers like blood pressure and cholesterol. Activities such as swimming and brisk walking are often highlighted for their accessibility and adaptability to different fitness levels, making them suitable for both younger adults and older individuals seeking sustainable ways to stay active.  \n\nFor elderly individuals, aerobic exercises like tai chi and qigong are emphasized not only for their cardiovascular benefits but also for their low-impact nature, which reduces strain on joints while still providing meaningful physical activity.
