It is classified as an **antihypertensive drug** and is administered intravenously for rapid blood pressure control in critical situations.  \n\nUrapidil is effective in managing severe hypertension, particularly when immediate intervention is required to prevent organ damage. While it is highly useful in emergencies, it may be associated with side effects such as **dizziness** and **fatigue**, which should be monitored during administration.  \n\nThe descriptions provided consistently highlight Urapidil's role in acute hypertension management, reinforcing its clinical application in emergencies. There are no significant contradictions in the given data, as all sources agree on its primary use, route of administration, and potential side effects.  \n\nIn summary, **Urapidil** is a fast-acting antihypertensive agent used intravenously for hypertensive crises, including cases involving cerebral hemorrhage, with known side effects that warrant careful patient monitoring.\",3\r\n1206,HYPERTENSION URGENCY,\"**Hypertension Urgency** is a medical condition characterized by severely elevated blood pressure, typically defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥180 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥120 mmHg. Unlike a **hypertension emergency**, it does not involve acute or progressive damage to target organs (such as the heart, brain, or kidneys). However, it still requires prompt medical attention to lower blood pressure and prevent potential complications. Treatment for hypertension urgency is less immediate than for an emergency, often involving oral antihypertensive medications and close monitoring, rather than intravenous therapy or hospitalization. The key distinction lies in the absence of acute organ dysfunction, allowing for a more controlled and gradual reduction in blood pressure. Proper management aims to mitigate the risk of progression to a hypertensive emergency or long-term cardiovascular damage.\",2\r\n1208,PREGNANCY-RELATED HYPERTENSION EMERGENCY,\"Hypertension emergency occurring in pregnant women, requiring careful blood pressure control to avoid affecting placental circulation\"\"\",1\r\n1212,NIFEDIPINE,,1\r\n1207,AORTIC DISSECTION,\"**Aortic Dissection** is a life-threatening medical condition characterized by a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, the body's largest artery. This tear allows blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall, potentially leading to severe complications such as rupture or organ damage. It is often associated with hypertensive emergencies, where uncontrolled high blood pressure exacerbates the risk of aortic wall injury. Compared to other hypertension-related emergencies, aortic dissection demands more urgent and aggressive blood pressure management to prevent further tearing or catastrophic outcomes.
