Notably, the December 2021 issue (Volume 20, Issue 12) featured research on general practice. In 2024, the journal published two significant consensus documents: the **Chinese expert consensus on adult blood lipid management in communities** and the **Chinese expert consensus on mixed hyperlipidemia**, highlighting its role in disseminating authoritative clinical guidance.
