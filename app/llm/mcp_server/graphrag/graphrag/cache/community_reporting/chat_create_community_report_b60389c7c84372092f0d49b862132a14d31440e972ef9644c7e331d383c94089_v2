As a leading authority, the CMA plays a pivotal role in developing and publishing clinical guidelines, consensus papers, and research to standardize and improve healthcare delivery across the country.  \n\nThe association is involved in a wide range of medical disciplines, addressing both common and specialized health issues. It has published guidelines for acute upper respiratory tract infections, emergency hypertension diagnosis and treatment, and primary care management of dyslipidemias (2019). Additionally, the CMA has compiled guidelines for common diseases in primary healthcare institutions, ensuring accessible and evidence-based care at the grassroots level. Notably, its branches—including Cardiology, Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Laboratory Medicine—contributed to the *Chinese Guidelines for Lipid Management (2023)*, reflecting its multidisciplinary expertise.  \n\nBeyond guideline development, the CMA oversees numerous medical specialty groups, such as obstetrics and gynecology, fostering collaboration among healthcare professionals. It also addresses broader academic integrity issues, such as duplicate submissions in medical journals, underscoring its commitment to ethical research practices.  \n\nIn summary, the Chinese Medical Association serves as a cornerstone of China’s medical community, unifying practitioners, shaping clinical standards, and promoting high-quality research to enhance patient care nationwide. Its comprehensive efforts span guideline dissemination, specialty coordination, and professional integrity, solidifying its role as a key influencer in China’s healthcare landscape.\",26\r\n1370,CHINESE SOCIETY OF CARDIOLOGY,\"The **Chinese Society of Cardiology (CSC)**, a branch of the **Chinese Medical Association**, plays a pivotal role in advancing cardiovascular medicine in China.
