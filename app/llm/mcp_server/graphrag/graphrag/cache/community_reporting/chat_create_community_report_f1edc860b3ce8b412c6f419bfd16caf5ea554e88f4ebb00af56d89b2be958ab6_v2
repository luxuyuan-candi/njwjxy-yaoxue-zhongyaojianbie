It is the leading cause of death globally and is often linked to high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol levels (hyperlipidemia), and other risk factors, including poor dietary habits, lack of exercise, and genetic predisposition.  \n\nThe condition arises from the narrowing or blockage of blood vessels due to atherosclerosis, a buildup of fatty deposits, which can lead to heart attacks, strokes, or other complications. Hypertension is both a contributing factor and a potential consequence of cardiovascular disease, emphasizing the need for regular risk assessment and management.  \n\nWhile cholesterol levels play a significant role in its development, other influences such as smoking, diabetes, obesity, and sedentary lifestyles also contribute. Effective management includes lifestyle modifications (e.g., improved diet, increased physical activity) and medical interventions to control blood pressure, cholesterol, and other underlying conditions.  \n\nDespite slight variations in phrasing, all descriptions agree that cardiovascular disease is a major health concern tied to heart and blood vessel dysfunction, with preventable and modifiable risk factors playing a central role in its progression.\",21\r\n1230,HEART RATE,\"A cardiovascular parameter monitored during hypertension management\"\"\",1\r\n1233,ECG,\"Electrocardiogram used to evaluate cardiac status in hypertension patients\"\"\",1\r\n1234,ULTRASOUND,\"Imaging tests like echocardiogram and carotid ultrasound used to assess organ damage in hypertension\"\"\",1\r\n4539,DIETARY FIBER,\"A component of plant-based foods that helps reduce cholesterol and supports metabolic health>\nA component of foods like oats, barley, and fruits that helps lower cholesterol and improve metabolic health>\",1\r\n4538,MEDITERRANEAN DIET,\"The **Mediterranean Diet** is a well-studied dietary pattern renowned for its heart-healthy benefits.
