It is also referenced in acupressure practices, particularly for home massage therapy as part of FDr (Fascial Distortion Model) treatment. In TCM, this point is commonly employed to regulate the spleen, liver, and kidney meridians, addressing conditions such as digestive disorders, gynecological issues, and fatigue. Its dual application in both acupuncture and acupressure highlights its therapeutic versatility, though its primary classification remains rooted in classical TCM as a key point on the spleen channel.  \n\nThe point is located on the inner lower leg, approximately three finger-widths above the medial malleolus (inner ankle bone), making it accessible for self-massage or professional needling. While its role in FDr treatment emphasizes manual pressure for fascial and musculoskeletal corrections, its TCM applications focus more on balancing qi and blood flow. Despite differing therapeutic frameworks, both descriptions agree on its anatomical position and its significance in holistic and alternative medicine practices.  \n\nIn summary, **三阴交** serves as a multifunctional point, integral to both traditional acupuncture and modern acupressure techniques, with its usage adapted to varying treatment modalities while retaining its foundational importance in TCM.\",2\r\n1591,足三里,\"**足三里 (Zusanli, ST36)** is a significant acupressure and acupuncture point in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It is commonly used in both home massage therapy and clinical acupuncture for its therapeutic benefits. As the lower he-sea point of the stomach meridian (胃的下合穴), it is particularly effective in treating abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal disorders.  \n\nIn clinical practice, 足三里 is frequently stimulated through acupuncture to alleviate abdominal discomfort and improve digestive function. Additionally, it is recommended for self-care practices, such as acupressure, as part of home-based therapies like FDr (Functional Diarrhea Relief) treatment.  \n\nThe point’s dual application—both in professional acupuncture and self-administered massage—highlights its versatility in TCM. While descriptions may vary slightly in emphasis (clinical vs. home use), they consistently affirm its role in addressing abdominal pain and related conditions. Thus, 足三里 serves as a key therapeutic point in both professional and personal healthcare within traditional Chinese medicine.\",7\r\n4305,天枢,\"An acupuncture point used in traditional Chinese medicine, located on the stomach meridian\"\"\",2\r\n4315,中脘,\"An acupuncture point used in traditional Chinese medicine, located on the conception vessel meridian\"\"\",2\r\n4306,关元,\"An acupuncture point used in traditional Chinese medicine, located on the conception vessel meridian\"\"\",3\r\n4313,气海,\"An acupuncture point used in traditional Chinese medicine, located on the conception vessel meridian\"\"\",1\r\n4314,内关,\"An acupuncture point used in traditional Chinese medicine, located on the pericardium meridian\"\"\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1358,FDR,三阴交,This acupressure point is recommended for massage in FDr treatment.,27\r\n4375,足三里,天枢,Both are acupuncture points used together in treating abdominal pain,9\r\n4379,足三里,中脘,Both are acupuncture points used together in acupoint injection for treating abdominal pain,9\r\n4380,天枢,关元,Both are acupuncture points used together in treating abdominal pain,5\r\n4381,关元,气海,Both are acupuncture points used together in moxibustion for treating abdominal pain,4\r\n4386,内关,中脘,Both are acupuncture points used together in acupoint injection for treating abdominal pain,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
