It accounts for approximately 75% of total cholesterol in the body. LDL plays a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of arterial plaques. When LDL levels are elevated, it deposits cholesterol in the walls of arteries, contributing to plaque formation and narrowing of the blood vessels. This process increases the risk of coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular complications. Due to its role in cholesterol transport and plaque accumulation, LDL is often referred to as \"\"bad cholesterol.\"\" Elevated LDL levels are strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, making it a critical biomarker in cardiovascular health assessments.\",5\r\n2169,HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"**High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)** is a type of cholesterol commonly referred to as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol due to its beneficial effects on heart health. HDL accounts for approximately 25% of total cholesterol in the body and plays a critical role in transporting excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver for processing and excretion, a process known as reverse cholesterol transport. This function helps prevent the buildup of cholesterol in arteries, thereby reducing the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.  \n\nHDL is measured in millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), with higher levels generally associated with better cardiovascular protection. Low HDL levels, conversely, correlate with an increased incidence of coronary heart disease. Beyond cholesterol transport, HDL activates key enzymes involved in lipoprotein metabolism and contributes to the clearance of cholesterol from tissues, further supporting its protective role in the cardiovascular system.  \n\nOverall, HDL is recognized for its ability to safeguard against heart disease by promoting efficient cholesterol removal and maintaining arterial health. Its multifaceted functions underscore its importance in cardiovascular risk assessment and preventive health strategies.\",5\r\n2157,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,\"**Atherosclerosis** is a chronic cardiovascular disease characterized by the progressive buildup of fatty plaques, primarily composed of cholesterol, lipids, and other substances, on the inner walls of arteries. This accumulation leads to the narrowing and hardening of the arteries, a process known as arteriosclerosis, which restricts blood flow and increases the risk of serious complications such as coronary heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes.  \n\nThe condition is strongly associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as \"\"bad\"\" cholesterol, as well as high lipidemia (excessive fats in the blood). These factors contribute to plaque formation, which can eventually rupture, triggering blood clots that further obstruct circulation. Conversely, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, known as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol, plays a protective role by helping to remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream, thereby slowing the progression of atherosclerosis.  \n\nAtherosclerosis develops gradually and is influenced by multiple risk factors, including poor diet, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and genetic predisposition. Over time, the narrowing of arteries reduces oxygen and nutrient supply to vital organs, potentially leading to life-threatening cardiovascular events.  \n\nIn summary, atherosclerosis is a systemic disease driven by lipid imbalances, particularly high LDL cholesterol, and is marked by arterial plaque buildup, arterial stiffening, and impaired blood flow. Management focuses on lifestyle modifications, cholesterol-lowering medications, and controlling underlying conditions to mitigate its progression and associated risks.\",12\r\n2297,LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,Low-density lipoprotein is referred to as 'bad' cholesterol associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases,5\r\n2331,TAIWAN MAKAY,\"Taiwan Makay is an institution with experience in weight control, noting that weight loss can lead to reduced blood cholesterol levels>\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1487,LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CHOLESTEROL,LDL carries cholesterol into surrounding tissues,28\r\n1488,HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CHOLESTEROL,HDL transports cholesterol from tissues back to the liver,28\r\n1766,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,Atherosclerosis can lead to myocardial infarction by blocking coronary arteries,19\r\n1696,LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,\"**Summary of LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN and ATHEROSCLEROSIS:**  \n\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL) plays a significant role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Often referred to as \"\"bad cholesterol,\"\" LDL contributes to the condition by depositing cholesterol on the walls of arteries. This accumulation leads to the formation of arterial plaques, which narrow and stiffen the blood vessels, impairing blood flow. Over time, these plaques can grow, increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications such as heart attacks and strokes.  \n\nThe descriptions consistently highlight LDL's involvement in atherosclerosis through cholesterol deposition in arterial walls, emphasizing its role in plaque formation. While the phrasing varies slightly across sources, the core mechanism remains the same: LDL transports cholesterol to arterial tissues, where it becomes trapped, triggering inflammatory responses and plaque buildup. This process underscores the importance of managing LDL levels to mitigate the risk of atherosclerosis and its associated health consequences.  \n\nIn summary, LDL is a key contributor to atherosclerosis by facilitating cholesterol deposition in arterial walls, leading to plaque formation and vascular dysfunction. Addressing elevated LDL levels through lifestyle changes or medical interventions is critical in preventing or slowing the progression of this disease.\",17\r\n1754,HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,TAIWAN MAKAY,Taiwan Makay's weight control programs have observed a correlation between weight loss and improved HDL levels,6\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
