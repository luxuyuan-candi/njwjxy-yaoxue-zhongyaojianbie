It plays a central role in the metabolism of a wide variety of pharmaceuticals, including statins (e.g., certain cholesterol-lowering drugs), beta-blockers, sedative-hypnotics, antidepressants, and R-warfarin. As the predominant enzyme in the CYP3A subfamily, CYP3A4 is highly influential in determining drug efficacy and safety.  \n\nCYP3A4 activity can be significantly altered by interactions with other substances. For instance, its function is inhibited by calcium channel blockers (e.g., amlodipine), strong antifungal agents (e.g., posaconazole and clarithromycin), and natural products like grapefruit juice, which can lead to elevated drug concentrations and potential toxicity. Conversely, CYP3A4 induction may reduce drug efficacy or cause fluctuations in blood pressure due to accelerated metabolism.  \n\nWhile some descriptions emphasize its role in metabolizing specific drugs (e.g., R-warfarin or statins), others highlight its broad involvement in drug metabolism. These variations reflect CYP3A4's diverse substrate specificity rather than contradictions. Overall, CYP3A4 is a key enzyme in pharmacokinetics, with its inhibition or induction having significant clinical implications for drug interactions and therapeutic outcomes.\",60\r\n4986,利伐沙班,\"Rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2J2, with increased bleeding risk when combined with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors\"\"\",3\r\n4944,ERYTHROMYCIN,Erythromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,2\r\n4899,卡格列净,\"卡格列净（Canagliflozin）是一种药物，其药代动力学特性在相关文本中有明确提及。该药物仅有7%通过CYP3A4酶代谢，表明其代谢途径主要依赖其他机制而非细胞色素P450系统中的CYP3A4酶。这一特性可能影响其药物相互作用潜力及代谢稳定性。综合现有描述，卡格列净的药理特征以低CYP3A4依赖性代谢为显著特点，但其具体药效学、适应症及完整代谢路径需进一步参考补充数据。  \n\n（注：根据要求，描述已控制在500字内，采用第三人称，合并并协调了所有输入信息，未发现矛盾。）\",1\r\n4930,卡马西平 (CARBAMAZEPINE),\"Carbamazepine is a CYP3A4 inducer that can affect drug metabolism\"\"\",1\r\n4931,苯巴比妥 (PHENOBARBITAL),\"Phenobarbital is a CYP3A4 inducer that can affect drug metabolism\"\"\",1\r\n4932,苯妥英 (PHENYTOIN),\"Phenytoin is a CYP3A4 inducer that can affect drug metabolism\"\"\",1\r\n4938,BISOPROLOL,Bisoprolol is a beta-blocker metabolized by CYP3A4,1\r\n834,KETOCONAZOLE,\"Ketoconazole is an over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections\"\"\",1\r\n4941,POSACONAZOLE,Posaconazole is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n4942,VORICONAZOLE,Voriconazole is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n4945,TELITHROMYCIN,Telithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n4946,AMIODARONE,Amiodarone is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n4947,AMLODIPINE,Amlodipine is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n4948,VERAPAMIL,Verapamil is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n5013,劳拉西泮,Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that is metabolized via glucuronidation rather than CYP3A4,1\r\n5014,奥沙西泮,Oxazepam is a benzodiazepine that is metabolized via glucuronidation rather than CYP3A4,1\r\n5015,夸西泮,Quazepam is a benzodiazepine that is metabolized via glucuronidation rather than CYP3A4,1\r\n5099,苯巴比妥,苯巴比妥 is a strong inducer of CYP3A4,1\r\n5101,地塞米松,地塞米松 is a strong inducer of CYP3A4,1\r\n3856,ATORVASTATIN,\"**Atorvastatin**, commonly known by its brand name *Lipitor*, is a high-intensity statin medication primarily used to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in the blood.

Atorvastatin is widely prescribed for patients with hypercholesterolemia or those at risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme critical to cholesterol production in the liver.
