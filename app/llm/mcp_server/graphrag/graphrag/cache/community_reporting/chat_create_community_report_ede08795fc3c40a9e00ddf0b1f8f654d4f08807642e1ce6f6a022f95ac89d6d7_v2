It facilitates the transport of various organic anions, including pharmaceuticals, influencing their absorption, distribution, and excretion. OATP1B1 is primarily expressed in the liver, where it mediates the uptake of drugs and other compounds from the blood into hepatocytes, thereby affecting their pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy. This transporter is essential for the hepatic clearance of many drugs, making it a key factor in drug-drug interactions and variability in drug response among individuals.  \n\nThe descriptions highlight its dual role in both drug distribution and excretion, as well as its specific function in hepatic drug uptake. Collectively, OATP1B1 is recognized as a significant transporter protein that impacts drug metabolism and disposition, with implications for pharmacology and personalized medicine.\",3\r\n3248,P-GP,\"**P-Glycoprotein (P-gp)** is a well-known transporter protein that plays a critical role in drug pharmacokinetics by influencing absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. It actively transports a wide range of drugs, including simvastatin and dabigatran etexilate, affecting their bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. P-gp is primarily involved in limiting drug absorption in the intestines, promoting drug excretion via the liver and kidneys, and modulating drug distribution across biological barriers such as the blood-brain barrier.  \n\nWhile some descriptions emphasize its role in drug metabolism, P-gp is more accurately characterized as a transporter rather than a metabolic enzyme. However, its activity indirectly influences drug metabolism by altering substrate availability for metabolic enzymes. Certain compounds, such as grapefruit juice, act as P-gp inhibitors, reducing its function and thereby increasing the systemic exposure of drugs that are P-gp substrates.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively highlight P-gp’s broad impact on drug disposition, with no major contradictions. Variations in phrasing (e.g., \"\"affects drug absorption and excretion\"\" vs. \"\"affects drug distribution and excretion\"\") reflect its multifaceted role rather than conflicting information. In summary, P-gp is a key transporter protein that regulates drug movement in the body, impacting therapeutic outcomes and interactions with inhibitors like grapefruit juice.\",9\r\n3271,西格列汀,西格列汀是一种药物，少量经CYP3A4和CYP2C8代谢，是P-gp的底物，与地高辛合用时需谨慎,3\r\n3249,OCT,OCT is a drug transporter protein that affects drug distribution and excretion,2\r\n3273,利格列汀,利格列汀是一种药物，基本不经CYP450酶代谢，是P-gp的底物，与P-gp诱导剂合用时疗效会降低,1\r\n3274,维格列汀,维格列汀是一种药物，基本不经CYP450酶代谢，是P-gp的底物，与ACEI合用时可能增加血管神经性水肿的风险,1\r\n3340,达比加群酯,\"Dabigatran etexilate is a P-gp substrate whose AUC increases significantly when combined with P-gp inhibitors, increasing bleeding risk\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2630,OATP1B1,P-GP,Both OATP1B1 and P-gp are drug transporter proteins,12\r\n2644,西格列汀,P-GP,西格列汀是P-gp的底物,12\r\n2632,P-GP,OCT,Both P-gp and OCT are drug transporter proteins,11\r\n2645,利格列汀,P-GP,利格列汀是P-gp的底物,10\r\n2646,维格列汀,P-GP,维格列汀是P-gp的底物,10\r\n2735,P-GP,达比加群酯,\"Dabigatran etexilate is a P-gp substrate, increasing AUC with inhibitors\",10\r\n2631,OATP1B1,OCT,Both OATP1B1 and OCT are drug transporter proteins,5\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
