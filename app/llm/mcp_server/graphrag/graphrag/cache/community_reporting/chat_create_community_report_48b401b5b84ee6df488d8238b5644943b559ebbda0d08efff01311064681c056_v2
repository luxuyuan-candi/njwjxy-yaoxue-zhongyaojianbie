This class encompasses several types of drugs, including **statins, niacin, resins, fibrates, and unsaturated fatty acids**, each targeting different mechanisms to manage lipid levels. Statins are among the most commonly prescribed, inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Niacin (vitamin B3) helps reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Resins, also known as bile acid sequestrants, bind bile acids in the intestine, promoting their excretion and forcing the liver to use cholesterol to produce more bile acids. Fibrates primarily lower triglycerides and may modestly increase HDL cholesterol. Unsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 fatty acids, contribute to triglyceride reduction and cardiovascular health.  \n\nWhile the descriptions vary slightly in their listed drug classes, they collectively emphasize the broad therapeutic scope of lipid-lowering drugs. The inclusion of both \"\"resins\"\" and \"\"fibrates\"\" alongside \"\"unsaturated fatty acids\"\" highlights the diversity of treatment options available for managing dyslipidemia. These medications are critical in reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with high cholesterol and triglyceride levels.  \n\nIn summary, lipid-lowering drugs represent a versatile group of therapies designed to address elevated lipid levels through multiple pharmacological pathways, with statins, fibrates, niacin, resins, and unsaturated fatty acids being key components of this category.\",2\r\n3527,UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS,\"Oils containing unsaturated fatty acids, such as soybean oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, and corn oil, which are recommended for consumption>\",5\r\n3909,FISH OIL PREPARATIONS,Fish oil preparations are mentioned as lipid-lowering agents,2\r\n3905,POLYENE,\"Polyene is mentioned as a lipid-lowering agent\nPolyene is mentioned as a substance that can cause digestive discomfort in large doses and can increase the anticoagulant effect of certain drugs\",2\r\n3910,MAI DONG KANG,Mai Dong Kang is a fish oil preparation mentioned in the text,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3932,LIPID-LOWERING DRUGS,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,Lipid-lowering drugs are the primary treatment for high lipidemia,55\r\n3407,UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS,WEIGHT MANAGEMENT,Using oils with unsaturated fatty acids contributes to weight management,12\r\n3951,FISH OIL PREPARATIONS,UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS,Fish oil preparations belong to the unsaturated fatty acids class of lipid-lowering agents,7\r\n3942,POLYENE,LIPID-LOWERING DRUGS,Polyene is mentioned as a type of lipid-lowering drug,4\r\n3952,FISH OIL PREPARATIONS,MAI DONG KANG,Mai Dong Kang is a type of fish oil preparation,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
