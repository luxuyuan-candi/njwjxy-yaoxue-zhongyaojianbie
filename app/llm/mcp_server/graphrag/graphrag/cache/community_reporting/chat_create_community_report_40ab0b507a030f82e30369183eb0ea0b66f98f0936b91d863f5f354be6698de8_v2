They function by blocking calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. CCBs are often prescribed in combination with other medications, such as angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), or ACE inhibitors (ACEI), particularly when monotherapy is insufficient for blood pressure control.  \n\nCCBs are further categorized into **dihydropyridine** (recommended for hypertension) and **non-dihydropyridine** (not typically recommended for hypertension) subtypes. They are particularly effective in specific patient populations, including those with:  \n- **Diabetes** (as part of combination therapy),  \n- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)** (for kidney protection),  \n- **Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)** and **lower extremity arterial disease**,  \n- **Stable coronary artery disease** (reducing myocardial oxygen consumption and angina attacks),  \n- **Systemic sclerosis** (as adjunct therapy when ACEI alone is inadequate),  \n- **Polycythemia vera (PV)** patients with hypertension.  \n\nAdditionally, CCBs have been associated with a reduced risk of dementia and are commonly used in **East Asia** due to their efficacy. They also enhance the effects of anesthetic and analgesic medications during surgery.  \n\nHowever, CCBs may cause side effects such as **ankle edema** and, when combined with antidepressants like SSRIs, may lead to **orthostatic hypotension**. Long-acting formulations are preferred in hypertension management.  \n\nIn summary, CCBs are versatile antihypertensive agents with broad applications in cardiovascular and renal protection, often used in combination therapies for optimal blood pressure control.\",51\n1568,ACCOMPLISH TRIAL,\"A clinical trial that compared the effectiveness of ACEI combined with CCB or diuretics in obese patients with hypertension\"\"\",2\n1136,DILTIAZEM,\"**Diltiazem** is a non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) used primarily for the treatment of hypertension, as well as for controlling blood pressure and heart rate.

As a calcium channel blocker, Diltiazem works by inhibiting calcium ion influx into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac cells, leading to vasodilation and reduced myocardial workload.
