These uses are not contradictory but rather reflect the formula's broad therapeutic scope in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). **小柴胡汤** thus serves as a versatile remedy for both external pathogenic conditions (e.g., fever syndromes) and internal imbalances (e.g., digestive disturbances caused by emotional or physiological stress).  \n\nIn summary, **小柴胡汤** is a well-known TCM prescription with dual applications: addressing alternating chills and fever, as well as harmonizing liver-spleen interactions to relieve abdominal pain and other related symptoms.
