This condition is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, particularly atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. While often asymptomatic in its early stages, untreated hyperlipidemia can lead to serious health complications.  \n\nSpecific thresholds for cholesterol and LDL levels are used to assess an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease. High lipid levels contribute to the buildup of plaque in the arteries (atherosclerosis), narrowing blood vessels and increasing the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes. Management typically involves lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes and increased physical activity, along with medications like statins when necessary. Early detection and intervention are crucial to mitigating long-term risks.\",7\r\n3504,LOVASTATIN,\"**Lovastatin** is a low-to-moderate intensity statin-class medication primarily used as a lipid-lowering drug. It has been clinically proven to reduce cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, making it an effective treatment for managing hyperlipidemia. As with other statins, lovastatin works by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a key role in cholesterol production in the liver.  \n\nWhile effective, lovastatin may cause potential adverse effects, including headaches, gastrointestinal disturbances, and, in rare cases, liver abnormalities. These side effects are consistent with those observed in other statin medications. Despite these risks, lovastatin remains a widely prescribed treatment due to its efficacy in lowering LDL cholesterol and improving cardiovascular health.  \n\nThe drug is referenced in medical literature as a well-established statin, reinforcing its role in cholesterol management. Overall, lovastatin is a balanced therapeutic option, offering moderate potency with a manageable safety profile for patients requiring lipid-lowering therapy.\",11\r\n3440,SIMVASTATIN,\"**Simvastatin** is a medication primarily used to treat high cholesterol and mixed hyperlipidemia. It is marketed under brand names such as **Zocor** and **舒降之**. As a **lipophilic statin**, simvastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol production in the liver. It is metabolized by the **CYP3A4** enzyme, which plays a key role in its pharmacokinetics and potential drug interactions.  \n\nSimvastatin helps lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, contributing to improved cardiovascular health. Its lipophilic nature allows it to penetrate cell membranes effectively, enhancing its therapeutic action. However, due to its metabolism via CYP3A4, caution is advised when co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., certain antibiotics, antifungals, or grapefruit juice), as this may increase the risk of adverse effects such as myopathy or liver toxicity.  \n\nIn summary, simvastatin is a widely used statin for managing dyslipidemia, available under multiple brand names, with its efficacy and safety influenced by its lipophilic properties and CYP3A4-dependent metabolism.\",11\r\n3918,STATIN CLASS,,4\r\n3857,CLOFIBRATE,\"**Clofibrate (Atromid-S)** is a lipid-lowering drug classified as a fibrate, primarily used to reduce elevated levels of triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol in the blood. It functions by modulating lipid metabolism, though the exact mechanism remains partially understood.  \n\nClofibrate is marketed under the brand name *Atromid-S* and is prescribed to manage hyperlipidemia, particularly in patients with high triglyceride levels. However, its use is accompanied by specific contraindications and potential side effects, which may include gastrointestinal disturbances, muscle pain, and, in rare cases, more severe reactions such as liver dysfunction or increased risk of gallstones. Due to these risks, its administration requires careful patient monitoring and adherence to prescribed guidelines.  \n\nWhile effective in lowering lipids, clofibrate has largely been replaced by newer fibrates with improved safety profiles. Nonetheless, it remains a recognized therapeutic option in certain clinical contexts. The drug should only be used under medical supervision, considering individual patient factors and potential drug interactions.\",2\r\n3894,IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS,\"Drugs that may interact dangerously with lovastatin, increasing risk of muscle disease\"\"\",1\r\n3896,ANTICOAGULANTS,\"Medications that may interact with lovastatin, potentially causing bleeding complications\"\"\",1\r\n3499,CEREBRAL THROMBOSIS,\"A type of stroke caused by blood clots in brain vessels, linked to lipid disorders\"\"\",1\r\n3908,XUE ZHI KANG,Xue Zhi Kang is a statin-class lipid-lowering drug mentioned in the text,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3201,PRAVASTATIN,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,Pravastatin is a prescribed medication for treating high lipidemia,61\r\n3338,HIGH LIPID LEVELS,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,High lipid levels are a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases,22\r\n3926,LOVASTATIN,SIMVASTATIN,Both are statin drugs with similar side effect profiles,22\r\n3199,SIMVASTATIN,PRAVASTATIN,\"**SIMVASTATIN and PRAVASTATIN** are statin medications primarily used to treat **high lipidemia** (elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels) by lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and improving overall lipid profiles.

While they share this class-wide safety precaution, they may differ in specific pharmacokinetic properties, such as metabolism and drug interactions, which can influence prescribing decisions.  \n\nIn summary, **SIMVASTATIN and PRAVASTATIN** are effective statins for managing **high lipidemia**, with shared requirements for **liver function monitoring** to ensure patient safety during treatment.
