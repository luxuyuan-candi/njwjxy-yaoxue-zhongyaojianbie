Research indicates that these fatty acids may help reduce high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, contributing to improved cardiovascular health. Additionally, epidemiological studies have observed a correlation between high fish consumption—and consequently, higher intake of 鱼油—and lower rates of cardiovascular disease among populations such as Eskimos in Greenland, as well as fishermen in Japan and the Netherlands. These findings suggest that regular consumption of 鱼油, as part of a diet rich in fish, may play a role in promoting heart health and reducing the risk of cardiovascular conditions.  \n\nThe combined evidence highlights 鱼油 as a valuable dietary supplement with potential benefits for lipid metabolism and cardiovascular protection. However, further research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms and optimal usage.
