It contains natural lovastatin and its analogs, along with other bioactive compounds, which contribute to its efficacy in managing hypercholesterolemia, particularly mild to moderate cases. As a statin-based drug, it reduces blood lipid levels and has been shown to lower the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile.  \n\nIn addition to its cholesterol-lowering effects, 血脂康 may assist in reducing blood sugar levels in diabetic patients, though its primary indication remains lipid regulation. It is classified as a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) preparation but shares pharmacological similarities with conventional statins due to its lovastatin content.  \n\nProduced domestically in China, 血脂康 is widely prescribed to modulate lipid metabolism and is recognized for its dual role as both a natural remedy and a clinically validated treatment for dyslipidemia. Its multi-component formulation distinguishes it from synthetic statins, offering a unique therapeutic profile within cardiovascular and metabolic care.  \n\n(Word count: 178)\",11\r\n3094,中国冠心病二级预防研究,中国冠心病二级预防研究证实血脂康具有明确的降脂作用，可降低心血管事件和死亡风险,1\r\n2322,甲状腺功能减退,\"甲状腺功能减退（简称甲减）是一种内分泌疾病，其特征是甲状腺激素分泌不足或作用减弱。该疾病可能引发多种代谢异常，其中包括对血脂水平的影响。根据相关描述，甲状腺功能减退可能导致血脂异常，具体表现为血清总胆固醇升高。这一现象与甲状腺激素在调节脂质代谢中的作用密切相关，因为甲状腺激素不足会减缓低密度脂蛋白（LDL）的清除速率，从而导致胆固醇在血液中积累。因此，甲状腺功能减退患者常被建议监测血脂水平，并在必要时接受干预以降低心血管疾病风险。  \n\n综上所述，甲状腺功能减退不仅是一种内分泌功能障碍，还可能通过影响脂质代谢导致血脂异常，尤其是血清总胆固醇升高。这一关联强调了甲减患者进行综合管理的重要性，包括甲状腺功能替代治疗和定期血脂监测。\",2\r\n2323,肝病,\"肝病是一种肝脏疾病，可能导致血清总胆固醇升高。\"\"\",1\r\n2550,骨质疏松,\"骨质疏松是威胁健康的另一个慢性病，运动可以使骨密度增加，改善老年人的生活质量。\"\"\",1\r\n2744,贝特类,贝特类药物是一类降脂药物，通常与他汀类药物合用，但需注意不良反应,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1583,高脂血症,肾病综合征,肾病综合征若未得到良好控制，可能导致高脂血症,112\r\n527,中华全科医师杂志,皮质醇增多症,The journal provides guidelines on diagnosing and managing Cushing's syndrome,41\r\n1641,糖尿病,冠心病,Diabetes is considered a coronary heart disease equivalent in patients with high blood lipids,37\r\n1727,单纯性高胆固醇血症,动脉粥样硬化,单纯性高胆固醇血症可能导致动脉粥样硬化,18\r\n1951,有氧运动,糖尿病,有氧运动可以帮助预防糖尿病，稳定血糖和胰岛素水平,13\r\n1998,他汀类,血脂康,血脂康是一种他汀类药物，用于治疗高胆固醇血症。,13\r\n2486,血脂康,中国冠心病二级预防研究,中国冠心病二级预防研究证实血脂康具有明确的降脂作用,12\r\n1729,单纯性高胆固醇血症,甲状腺功能减退,甲状腺功能减退可能导致单纯性高胆固醇血症,10\r\n1731,单纯性高胆固醇血症,肝病,肝病可能导致单纯性高胆固醇血症,9\r\n1952,有氧运动,骨质疏松,有氧运动可以增加骨密度，改善老年人的生活质量，从而对骨质疏松有积极影响,4\r\n2112,他汀类,贝特类,他汀类和贝特类药物可以合用，但需注意不良反应,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
