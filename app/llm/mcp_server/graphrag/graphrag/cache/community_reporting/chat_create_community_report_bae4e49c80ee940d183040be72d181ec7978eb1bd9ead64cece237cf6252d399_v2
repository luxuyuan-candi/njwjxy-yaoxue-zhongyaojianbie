It is administered at a dosage of 1-3g/Kg/day and requires monitoring of renal function and electrolytes to maintain internal stability. In some cases, intracranial pressure monitoring may be necessary.\",4\r\n1254,DIURETICS,\"**Diuretics** are a class of medications primarily used to reduce blood pressure by eliminating excess sodium and water from the body through increased urine production. They are often denoted by the letter \"\"D\"\" in treatment protocols. In addition to their role in managing hypertension, diuretics are also employed to treat conditions such as increased intracranial pressure, where they help alleviate pressure by promoting fluid excretion.  \n\nHowever, the use of diuretics requires careful monitoring of renal function and electrolyte levels to prevent imbalances that could disrupt internal stability. While their mechanisms vary by type (e.g., loop, thiazide, or potassium-sparing diuretics), their overarching purpose remains the management of fluid retention and pressure-related conditions. By addressing both cardiovascular and neurological concerns, diuretics serve as a versatile therapeutic tool, though their administration must be tailored to individual patient needs to mitigate potential side effects.\",2\r\n1251,GLYCEROL FRUCTOSE,Glycerol Fructose is another dehydration agent used alongside 20% Mannitol to manage increased intracranial pressure.
