The study investigates whether alterations in this ECG marker—a known indicator of left ventricular hypertrophy and adverse cardiovascular outcomes—can predict patient prognosis when treated with antihypertensive therapies. By analyzing these changes, the LIFE study aims to provide insights into the relationship between ECG strain patterns, blood pressure management, and long-term cardiovascular risk.  \n\nThe descriptions consistently emphasize the study's primary objective: assessing the prognostic value of ECG strain pattern modifications in the context of antihypertensive treatment.
