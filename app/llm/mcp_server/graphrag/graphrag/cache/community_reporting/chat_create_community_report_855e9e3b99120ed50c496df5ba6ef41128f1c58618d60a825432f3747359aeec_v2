It is a diagnostic procedure used to assess key aspects of swallowing, including **penetration** (when food or liquid enters the airway but does not pass below the vocal folds), **aspiration** (when material enters the airway below the vocal folds), and **residue** (remaining material in the pharynx after swallowing). While the VFSS is a critical tool for assessing swallowing disorders in general, it is particularly emphasized as the gold standard for evaluating swallowing function in **stroke patients**, who often experience dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) as a result of neurological impairment. The procedure utilizes real-time X-ray imaging (fluoroscopy) to visualize the swallowing mechanism, providing clinicians with detailed insights to guide treatment and management strategies.  \n\nBy combining these descriptions, it is clear that the VFSS serves as the most reliable method for diagnosing swallowing impairments across various patient populations, with a strong emphasis on its role in stroke-related dysphagia assessment. The summary remains consistent, as both descriptions reinforce the VFSS's status as the gold standard while highlighting its broader applicability alongside its specific importance for stroke patients.\",5\r\n5469,FEES,\"**Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES)** is an objective and clinically valuable method for assessing swallowing function, particularly in stroke patients. FEES provides a direct visualization of pharyngeal and laryngeal movements during swallowing, offering real-time insights into swallowing mechanics. It is considered a cost-effective alternative to Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS), another common diagnostic tool for dysphagia. FEES is widely recognized for its utility in evaluating swallowing disorders, enabling clinicians to identify abnormalities and tailor appropriate interventions. By combining endoscopic imaging with functional assessment, FEES serves as a reliable and efficient diagnostic approach in both clinical and research settings.\",5\r\n5491,饮水试验,,2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n5957,SWALLOWING DISORDER,STROKE,22-65% of stroke patients develop swallowing disorders requiring rehabilitation,65\r\n5953,VFSS,FEES,\"**VFSS and FEES: Comprehensive Summary**  \n\nVFSS (Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study) and FEES (Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing) are both objective diagnostic methods used to evaluate swallowing function, particularly in patients with swallowing disorders such as stroke patients. These techniques are clinically recommended for further examination of individuals who exhibit positive results in preliminary screenings like the water swallow test (Ⅰ级推荐, A级证据).  \n\nWhile both methods serve the same primary purpose—assessing swallowing dysfunction—they differ in practicality and application. VFSS utilizes X-ray imaging to visualize the swallowing process in real time, providing a dynamic assessment of oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases. In contrast, FEES employs a flexible endoscope to directly observe pharyngeal and laryngeal structures during swallowing, making it a more portable and cost-effective alternative.  \n\nFEES is often preferred in settings where radiation exposure is a concern or when bedside evaluation is necessary due to its ease of transport. However, VFSS remains valuable for its ability to capture the entire swallowing sequence, including the esophageal phase, which FEES cannot assess. Both methods are considered reliable and are used interchangeably depending on clinical needs, patient condition, and resource availability.  \n\nIn summary, VFSS and FEES are complementary diagnostic tools for swallowing disorders, with FEES offering portability and cost advantages, while VFSS provides a more comprehensive visualization of the swallowing mechanism.
