They are considered the first-line treatment for patients with arteriosclerosis and high-risk groups due to their efficacy in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, moderately reducing very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglycerides, and slightly increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels.  \n\nIn addition to cholesterol reduction, statins help stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. They are particularly effective in treating hypercholesterolemia and are often combined with other lipid-lowering agents for managing mixed hyperlipidemia. Commonly prescribed statins include **Lovastatin, Simvastatin, Pravastatin, and Atorvastatin**.  \n\nStatins are generally well-tolerated and do not exhibit significant interactions with antihypertensive medications, making them suitable for patients with concurrent hypertension. Their multifaceted benefits—cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition, plaque stabilization, and cardiovascular risk reduction—solidify their role as a cornerstone in lipid management therapy.\",14\r\n3089,FENOFIBRATE,\"**Fenofibrate** is a fibrate-class drug administered orally in tablet form, typically at a dosage of 0.1 g per dose, taken three times daily. It is primarily used to reduce elevated triglyceride levels in the blood and is often prescribed in combination with statins or ω-3 fatty acids for the treatment of mixed hyperlipidemia. By targeting lipid metabolism, fenofibrate helps manage dyslipidemia and supports cardiovascular health. Its dual role as a standalone therapy and a complementary treatment alongside other lipid-lowering agents makes it a versatile option for patients with hypertriglyceridemia or mixed lipid disorders. The drug's oral tablet formulation ensures ease of administration, while its dosing regimen is designed to maintain therapeutic efficacy.\",3\r\n2595,RESINS,\"The only safe lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy\"\"\",1\r\n2572,FIBRATES,\"**Fibrates** are a class of drugs primarily used to lower triglyceride levels and, to a lesser extent, increase HDL (\"\"good\"\") cholesterol levels. This group includes medications such as **fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, and clofibrate**. Fibrates work through multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of adenylate cyclase, reduction of fatty acid release, and enhancement of lipoprotein lipase activity. These actions collectively lead to decreased levels of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and total cholesterol.  \n\nWhile their primary therapeutic effect is on triglycerides, fibrates also exhibit modest benefits in raising HDL cholesterol. Their pharmacological properties make them particularly useful in managing hypertriglyceridemia and mixed dyslipidemia. The class encompasses several specific drugs, each with slight variations in efficacy and mechanism, but all share the common goal of improving lipid profiles.  \n\nIn summary, fibrates are a well-established class of lipid-modifying agents with a focus on triglyceride reduction, supported by additional effects on other lipid parameters, including HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.\",7\r\n2573,PROBUCOL,\"Probucol, also known as 'Bifenabid,' is a highly lipophilic compound with lipid-regulating properties>\",1\r\n3090,GEMFIBROZIL,\"Gemfibrozil is a fibrate drug administered orally in capsule form, 0.2 or 0.25 g per dose, once daily.\"\"\",1\r\n3091,BEZAFIBRATE,\"Bezafibrate is a fibrate drug administered orally, 0.3 or 0.6 g per dose, twice daily.\"\"\",1\r\n3092,CIPROFIBRATE,\"Ciprofibrate is a fibrate drug administered orally, 0.1 g per dose, once daily.\"\"\",1\r\n2307,HIGH LIPIDEMIA PREVENTION,\"An event or activity focused on preventing high lipidemia through diet, exercise, and medication>\",2\r\n2309,PRAVASTATIN,A medication used to lower cholesterol and treat hyperlipidemia>,4\r\n3099,Ω-3 FATTY ACIDS,\"Prescription-grade ω-3 fatty acids are used to lower triglyceride levels by inhibiting VLDL-C generation, promoting its clearance, and activating lipoprotein lipase.
