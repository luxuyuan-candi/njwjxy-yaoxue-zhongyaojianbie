It is effective in managing severe hypertriglyceridemia, often in combination with other treatments such as fibrates or ω-3 fatty acids. However, nicotinic acid has notable limitations, particularly in patients with diabetes, as it can worsen glucose tolerance and is therefore not recommended for diabetic individuals.  \n\nIn summary, nicotinic acid serves as a therapeutic option for lipid regulation, particularly in cases of severe hypertriglyceridemia, but its use requires careful consideration of metabolic effects, especially in diabetic patients. The drug’s benefits in lipid management must be weighed against its potential adverse impact on glucose metabolism.\",4\r\n3919,NICOTINIC ACID CLASS,,3\r\n4001,GLUCOSE TOLERANCE,\"Glucose tolerance refers to the body's ability to process sugar, which can be affected by certain medications\",2\r\n3854,INOSITOL NICOTINATE,\"**Inositol Nicotinate** is an ester compound composed of one molecule of inositol and six molecules of niacin (vitamin B3). Upon ingestion, it undergoes gradual metabolism in the body, releasing both niacin and inositol over time. This slow-release mechanism contributes to its therapeutic effects, which include improving lipid metabolism and promoting vasodilation.  \n\nPrimarily recognized as a lipid-lowering agent, Inositol Nicotinate is used to manage dyslipidemia by modulating cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Its vasodilatory properties further support cardiovascular health by enhancing blood flow. The combined actions of niacin (known for its lipid-regulating effects) and inositol (a sugar alcohol with potential metabolic benefits) make Inositol Nicotinate a multifaceted compound in supporting circulatory and metabolic functions.  \n\nThe descriptions align in characterizing Inositol Nicotinate as a slow-release niacin derivative with dual benefits for lipid regulation and vascular health, without noted contradictions.\",2\r\n3853,ACIPIMOX,\"**ACIPIMOX**  \n\nAcipimox is a synthetic derivative of nicotinic acid (niacin) belonging to the niacin-class of drugs. It is also known as *Oxylytic Acid* and shares similar therapeutic applications with niacin but exhibits longer-lasting and more potent anti-lipolytic effects. Primarily administered orally, the typical dosage is **0.25 g per dose**, taken **two to three times daily**.  \n\nAcipimox is primarily used to **lower triglyceride and cholesterol levels** in the blood, making it beneficial for managing dyslipidemia. Additionally, it has been shown to **improve glucose tolerance**, which may be advantageous for patients with metabolic disorders. Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting lipolysis, thereby reducing the release of free fatty acids and improving lipid metabolism.  \n\nIn summary, Acipimox is a niacin-derived medication with enhanced efficacy and duration of action, prescribed for its lipid-modifying and glucose-regulating properties. Its oral administration and well-defined dosing regimen make it a practical option for long-term management of hyperlipidemia and related metabolic conditions.\",3\r\n3912,PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRANICOTINATE,Pentaerythrityl tetranicotinate is mentioned as a lipid-lowering agent,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3953,NICOTINIC ACID,NICOTINIC ACID CLASS,Nicotinic acid belongs to the nicotinic acid class of lipid-lowering agents,7\r\n4091,NICOTINIC ACID,GLUCOSE TOLERANCE,Nicotinic acid can worsen glucose tolerance in diabetic patients,6\r\n3954,INOSITOL NICOTINATE,NICOTINIC ACID CLASS,Inositol nicotinate belongs to the nicotinic acid class of lipid-lowering agents,5\r\n4092,ACIPIMOX,GLUCOSE TOLERANCE,Acipimox can improve glucose tolerance in diabetic patients,5\r\n3955,PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRANICOTINATE,NICOTINIC ACID CLASS,Pentaerythrityl tetranicotinate belongs to the nicotinic acid class of lipid-lowering agents,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
