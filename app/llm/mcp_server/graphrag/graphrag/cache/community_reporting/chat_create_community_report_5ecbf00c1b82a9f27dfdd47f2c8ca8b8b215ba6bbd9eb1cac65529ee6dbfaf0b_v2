Additionally, it can cause depressive symptoms as one of its psychological or physiological effects. The condition arises from prolonged exposure to high levels of cortisol, whether due to endogenous overproduction or exogenous sources, and presents a distinct clinical profile that includes metabolic, cardiovascular, and psychological disturbances.
