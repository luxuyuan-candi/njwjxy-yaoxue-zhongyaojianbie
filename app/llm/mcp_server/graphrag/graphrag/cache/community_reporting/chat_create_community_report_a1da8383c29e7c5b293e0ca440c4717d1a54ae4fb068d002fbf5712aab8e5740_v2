They are effective in treating renal vascular hypertension when used as part of combination therapy. Additionally, they are indicated for hypertension cases complicated by conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), essential tremor, abnormal glucose or lipid metabolism, and refractory hypertension.  \n\nΑ受体阻滞剂 also play a critical role in the preoperative management of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), where they are routinely administered to prepare patients for surgery. Their versatility makes them suitable for both general hypertension treatment and specialized clinical situations, including BPH and metabolic disorders.  \n\nIn summary, Α受体阻滞剂 serve as a multifaceted therapeutic option, addressing hypertension in complex cases while also being essential in surgical preparations for PPGL.\",3\n1299,利尿剂,\"利尿剂（Diuretics）是一类降压药（antihypertensive drug），通过促进利尿（diuresis）发挥作用。它们被纳入治疗肾血管性高血压（renal vascular hypertension）的多药联合方案中，同时也适用于下肢动脉疾病合并高血压患者的初始联合降压治疗。此外，利尿剂与其他药物的相互作用较小，尤其是与抗抑郁药的相互作用较少。  \n\n然而，在手术前需注意调整用药，通常建议在术前2-3天停用利尿剂，以避免电解质紊乱（electrolyte imbalances）的风险。  \n\n综上，利尿剂作为一类重要的降压药物，在多种高血压治疗方案中具有明确作用，但需根据临床情况（如手术前）调整使用，以确保安全性和疗效。\",6\n1102,Β受体阻滞剂,\"**Β受体阻滞剂 (Beta-blockers)** are a class of drugs widely used in the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions. They function by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors, thereby inhibiting sympathetic nervous system activity, reducing heart rate, and decreasing myocardial contractility, which collectively lower blood pressure. Β受体阻滞剂 are recommended as a **first-line treatment** for hypertensive patients with elevated heart rate and are also effective in managing **renal vascular hypertension**.  \n\nThese medications are categorized into subtypes, including **non-selective beta-blockers**, **highly selective β1-blockers**, and **α1/β-blockers**, each with specific clinical applications. They are particularly beneficial for patients with comorbid conditions such as **coronary artery disease (CAD)**, **chronic heart failure (HFrEF)**, and **aortic dissection**, where they improve prognosis, reduce hospitalization rates, and lower mortality. Additionally, β受体阻滞剂 are used as **adjunctive therapy for tachycardia** in preoperative preparation for pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL) and are considered safe for hypertensive patients with **lower extremity arterial stenosis**.  \n\nBeyond cardiovascular uses, β受体阻滞剂 are prescribed for **hyperthyroidism-related hypertension** due to their ability to counteract excessive adrenergic stimulation. However, they may cause side effects such as **fatigue** and **cold extremities** and can **mask hypoglycemia symptoms** in diabetic patients, requiring cautious use.  \n\nΒ受体阻滞剂 can be combined with other antihypertensive agents, such as **ARNI (angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors)**, for enhanced therapeutic effects. Overall, they remain a cornerstone in hypertension and cardiovascular disease management, with both traditional and evolving clinical applications.\",19\n1276,慢性阻塞性肺疾病,,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1218,ACEI,二氢吡啶类,二氢吡啶类 CCB is often combined with ACEI in SPC formulations,56\n1165,Α受体阻滞剂,高血压,Α受体阻滞剂（α受体阻滞剂）是一类适用于高血压治疗的药物，尤其在高血压合并多种临床情况时显示出疗效。具体而言，该药物适用于高血压伴有良性前列腺增生等特殊情况的患者，表明其在特定合并症中的治疗价值。两种描述共同强调了Α受体阻滞剂在高血压综合管理中的针对性应用，尤其针对存在其他并发症（如良性前列腺增生）的患者群体。,43\n1682,利尿剂,CKD,利尿剂 is mentioned in the context of hypertension management for CKD patients,42\n1151,Β受体阻滞剂,阿替洛尔,阿替洛尔是β受体阻滞剂的一种，用于治疗高血压,21\n1152,Β受体阻滞剂,慢性阻塞性肺疾病,高选择性β1受体阻滞剂对慢性阻塞性肺疾病患者是安全的,20\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
