It is classified as a crystal-related arthropathy caused by disruptions in purine metabolism and/or impaired uric acid excretion, leading to chronic high serum uric acid levels.  \n\nThe condition typically manifests as sudden, severe joint inflammation, with symptoms including redness, swelling, and intense pain, commonly affecting lower-extremity joints such as the first metatarsophalangeal joint (big toe), ankles, knees, and heels. Acute attacks often resolve within days to two weeks but may recur, especially when triggered by factors like alcohol consumption, high-purine diets, cold exposure, or strenuous exercise. Over time, untreated gout can lead to chronic joint damage and atypical symptoms. Severe episodes may also present with systemic symptoms like fever, chills, fatigue, and palpitations.  \n\nGout is associated with multiple comorbidities, including metabolic syndrome components such as hyperlipidemia (elevated cholesterol and triglycerides), hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease. Some patients may develop kidney complications due to urate crystal deposition or impaired renal function. Management focuses on lowering uric acid levels through pharmacological therapy (e.g., urate-lowering drugs) and lifestyle modifications to prevent recurrent attacks and long-term damage.  \n\nGlobally, gout prevalence varies by region, influenced by dietary habits, genetic factors, and healthcare access. While primarily a joint disease, its systemic metabolic implications underscore the need for comprehensive treatment addressing both acute symptoms and underlying hyperuricemia.\",33\r\n255,急性尿酸性肾病,\"急性尿酸性肾病是由于血和尿中尿酸浓度急剧上升，大量尿酸沉积并堵塞于肾小管、集合管等处，导致急性尿路梗阻。临床表现为急性少尿、无尿，急性肾衰竭，尿中可见大量尿酸。\"\"\",1\r\n271,第一跖趾关节,,1\r\n257,足背,\"足背是痛风好发的下肢关节部位之一\"\"\",1\r\n258,足跟,\"足跟是痛风好发的下肢关节部位之一\"\"\",1\r\n259,踝关节,\"踝关节是痛风好发的下肢关节部位之一\"\"\",1\r\n260,膝关节,\"膝关节是痛风好发的下肢关节部位之一\"\"\",1\r\n261,指关节,\"指关节是痛风可能累及的上肢关节部位\"\"\",1\r\n262,肘关节,\"肘关节是痛风可能累及的上肢关节部位\"\"\",1\r\n263,腕关节,\"腕关节是痛风可能累及的上肢关节部位\"\"\",1\r\n264,骶髂关节,\"随着病程进展，痛风可能累及骶髂关节\"\"\",1\r\n265,肩关节,\"随着病程进展，痛风可能累及肩关节\"\"\",1\r\n266,脊柱关节,\"随着病程进展，痛风可能累及脊柱关节\"\"\",1\r\n293,痛风性关节炎,\"A specific manifestation of gout involving joint inflammation caused by urate crystal deposition\"\"\",1\r\n294,双能 CT,\"A diagnostic imaging technique with 84% sensitivity and 93% specificity for detecting urate crystals in gout\"\"\",1\r\n295,关节腔穿刺,\"A diagnostic procedure involving joint fluid extraction to identify monosodium urate crystals for gout confirmation\"\"\",1\r\n296,痛风石抽吸,\"A diagnostic procedure involving tophus aspiration to identify urate crystals for gout diagnosis\"\"\",1\r\n303,慢性肾脏病,\"慢性肾脏病 (CKD) is a long-term condition where kidney function is progressively impaired, often associated with gout and hyperuricemia\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n197,痛风,高尿酸血症,痛风（Gout）是一种与高尿酸血症（Hyperuricemia）密切相关的疾病，主要由长期的高尿酸血症引发。高尿酸血症是痛风的主要病因，其特征是血液中尿酸水平持续升高，导致尿酸盐结晶在关节及周围组织中沉积，从而引发痛风的急性炎症反应和剧烈疼痛。两者的关系表现为：高尿酸血症为痛风的病理基础，而痛风则是高尿酸血症的常见临床表现之一。这一关联性在医学研究中已得到广泛证实，且中英文描述均强调了高尿酸血症在痛风发病中的核心作用。因此，痛风与高尿酸血症可视为同一病理过程的不同阶段或表现，而非独立的疾病实体。,37\r\n205,痛风,急性尿酸性肾病,痛风患者可能因尿酸浓度急剧上升导致急性尿酸性肾病,34\r\n207,痛风,第一跖趾关节,第一跖趾关节是痛风最常见的发作部位,34\r\n208,痛风,足背,足背是痛风好发的下肢关节部位,34\r\n209,痛风,足跟,足跟是痛风好发的下肢关节部位,34\r\n210,痛风,踝关节,踝关节是痛风好发的下肢关节部位,34\r\n211,痛风,膝关节,膝关节是痛风好发的下肢关节部位,34\r\n212,痛风,指关节,指关节是痛风可能累及的上肢关节部位,34\r\n213,痛风,肘关节,肘关节是痛风可能累及的上肢关节部位,34\r\n214,痛风,腕关节,腕关节是痛风可能累及的上肢关节部位,34\r\n215,痛风,骶髂关节,随着病程进展，痛风可能累及骶髂关节,34\r\n216,痛风,肩关节,随着病程进展，痛风可能累及肩关节,34\r\n217,痛风,脊柱关节,随着病程进展，痛风可能累及脊柱关节,34\r\n248,痛风性关节炎,痛风,Gouty arthritis is a specific clinical manifestation of gout,34\r\n249,双能 CT,痛风,Dual-energy CT is a diagnostic tool for detecting urate crystals in gout,34\r\n250,关节腔穿刺,痛风,Joint aspiration is a diagnostic method for gout through crystal identification,34\r\n251,痛风石抽吸,痛风,Tophus aspiration confirms gout diagnosis through urate crystal identification,34\r\n260,痛风,慢性肾脏病,Chronic kidney disease is a common comorbidity in gout patients and can affect uric acid excretion,34\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
