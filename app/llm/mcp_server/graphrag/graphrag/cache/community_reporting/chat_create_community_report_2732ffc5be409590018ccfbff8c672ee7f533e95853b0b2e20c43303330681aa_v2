It provides an estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which reflects how well the kidneys are filtering waste from the blood. eGFR is commonly employed to assess and stage chronic kidney disease (CKD), helping healthcare providers monitor disease progression and guide treatment decisions. Additionally, it is a valuable tool for evaluating kidney function in patients with hypertension, as hypertension can contribute to kidney damage over time. The term \"\"eGFR\"\" stands for \"\"estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate,\"\" emphasizing its role as an approximation rather than a direct measurement. Overall, eGFR serves as a key indicator of renal health across various clinical contexts.\",4\r\n1159,CKD,\"**Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** is a medical condition characterized by the progressive loss of kidney function over time. It is categorized into stages based on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which measures how well the kidneys filter waste from the blood. CKD is also recognized as a significant risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), highlighting its broader impact on overall health. The condition requires careful management to mitigate complications, including cardiovascular risks, and often involves monitoring kidney function, dietary adjustments, and medical interventions to slow progression.\",4\r\n1161,IMT,\"**IMT (Intima-Media Thickness)** is a medical measurement used to assess the thickness of the arterial wall, specifically the combined thickness of the intima and media layers. It serves as an important indicator for evaluating target organ damage, particularly in patients with hypertension. The measurement helps clinicians identify early signs of atherosclerosis or other vascular abnormalities, providing insights into cardiovascular health. Both descriptions agree on IMT's role in measuring arterial wall thickness and its clinical utility in hypertension-related assessments.
