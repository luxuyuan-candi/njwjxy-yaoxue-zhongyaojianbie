It is a long-acting NSAID, typically administered at a dosage of 250 mg three times daily, and has a half-life of 10–18 hours, which allows for sustained relief.  \n\nThe descriptions provided consistently highlight its primary uses—managing pain and reducing inflammation—as well as its availability without a prescription. The slight variation in phrasing (e.g., \"\"Naproxen is an over-the-counter NSAID\"\" vs. \"\"An over-the-counter NSAID\"\") does not introduce contradictions but rather reinforces the same key points.  \n\nIn summary, 萘普生 is a widely accessible NSAID with prolonged effects due to its extended half-life, making it suitable for managing persistent pain and inflammation. Its dosage and pharmacological properties ensure sustained therapeutic action.\",2\r\n1043,甲氨蝶呤,\"甲氨蝶呤（Methotrexate）是一种药物，已知与某些其他药物联合使用时会导致其血药浓度升高，甚至可能引发中毒风险。根据提供的描述，甲氨蝶呤与阿司匹林（aspirin）合用时，尤其是在高剂量情况下，其血药浓度会显著增加。此外，甲氨蝶呤与布洛芬（ibuprofen）同时服用时，同样会导致血药浓度增高，甚至可能引发中毒。  \n\n这两种描述共同表明，甲氨蝶呤与抗炎药物（如阿司匹林和布洛芬）的相互作用可能增强其毒性，因此临床使用时需谨慎监测血药浓度，并调整剂量以避免不良反应。尽管两种描述提及不同的药物（阿司匹林和布洛芬），但均指向类似的药物相互作用机制，即非甾体抗炎药（NSAIDs）可能影响甲氨蝶呤的代谢或排泄，从而增加其血药浓度。  \n\n综上，甲氨蝶呤在与阿司匹林或布洛芬等NSAIDs合用时，存在血药浓度升高的风险，临床应密切监测并评估潜在毒性。\",2\r\n1044,口服降血糖药物,\"口服降血糖药物是一类药物，与布洛芬同时服用会导致血药浓度增高甚至中毒。\"\"\",1\r\n1045,呋塞咪,\"呋塞咪是一种药物，与布洛芬同时服用会降低降压效果。\"\"\",1\r\n1046,高血压药物,\"高血压药物是一类药物，与布洛芬同时服用会降低降压效果。\"\"\",1\r\n1012,奥卡西平,奥卡西平不可与对乙酰氨基酚合用，以避免增加肝毒性,1\r\n1067,苯妥英钠,\"苯妥英钠是一种药物，与对乙酰氨基酚合用会降低疗效并产生肝损伤。\"\"\",1\r\n1006,银杏叶片,银杏叶片是一种药物，主要成分为黄酮化合物，具有抗血小板凝聚作用，需避免与阿司匹林等抗血小板药物联合使用以防止出血事件发生,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n330,对乙酰氨基酚,布洛芬,\"对乙酰氨基酚和布洛芬是两种常用的药物，主要用于缓解疼痛和退烧。它们均被推荐作为儿童退烧药，具有相似的疗效和安全性。  \n\n对乙酰氨基酚（也称为扑热息痛）是一种广泛使用的解热镇痛药，适用于轻至中度疼痛（如头痛、牙痛、关节痛）以及发热症状。其作用机制主要通过抑制中枢神经系统中的前列腺素合成，从而发挥镇痛和退热效果。对乙酰氨基酚在儿童和成人中均表现出良好的耐受性，但需注意剂量控制，过量可能导致肝毒性。  \n\n布洛芬则是一种非甾体抗炎药（NSAID），除了镇痛和退热作用外，还具有抗炎效果，适用于炎症相关的疼痛（如肌肉酸痛、关节炎）。其作用机制是通过抑制环氧化酶（COX）来减少前列腺素的生成。布洛芬同样适用于儿童，但可能对胃肠道产生轻微刺激，因此建议在餐后服用以减少不适。  \n\n研究表明，对乙酰氨基酚和布洛芬在退热和镇痛方面的效果相近，且安全性良好，因此在儿科实践中常被交替使用或根据患者个体情况选择。不过，对乙酰氨基酚因其较低的胃肠道副作用，更适合有胃部敏感问题的患者，而布洛芬则因其抗炎特性更适用于伴随炎症的疼痛症状。  \n\n总体而言，这两种药物均为有效且安全的解热镇痛选择，但在使用时需遵循医嘱，注意剂量和禁忌症，以确保最佳疗效和最小副作用。\",17\r\n713,阿司匹林,华法林,阿司匹林与华法林合用会增加出血倾向,17\r\n367,非甾体抗炎药,萘普生,Naproxen is a type of NSAID,13\r\n372,布洛芬,萘普生,Both are over-the-counter NSAIDs used for pain relief,12\r\n682,布洛芬,甲氨蝶呤,布洛芬与甲氨蝶呤同时服用会导致血药浓度增高甚至中毒,12\r\n683,布洛芬,口服降血糖药物,布洛芬与口服降血糖药物同时服用会导致血药浓度增高甚至中毒,11\r\n684,布洛芬,呋塞咪,布洛芬与呋塞咪同时服用会降低降压效果,11\r\n685,布洛芬,高血压药物,布洛芬与高血压药物同时服用会降低降压效果,11\r\n663,奥卡西平,对乙酰氨基酚,奥卡西平不可与对乙酰氨基酚合用以避免增加肝毒性,8\r\n711,对乙酰氨基酚,苯妥英钠,对乙酰氨基酚与苯妥英钠合用会降低疗效并产生肝损伤,8\r\n660,银杏叶片,阿司匹林,银杏叶片与阿司匹林联合使用可能增加出血风险,6\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
