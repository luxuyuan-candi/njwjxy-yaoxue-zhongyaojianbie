It plays a key role in the breakdown of medications such as **R-warfarin** and **zolpidem**, demonstrating its importance in drug processing. Additionally, CYP1A2 is strongly inhibited by **fluvoxamine**, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), which can affect the metabolism of substrates dependent on this enzyme.  \n\nThe enzyme is consistently described as a metabolic catalyst, with multiple sources highlighting its involvement in the metabolism of **R-warfarin**, a commonly referenced substrate. While some descriptions emphasize its role in processing specific drugs like zolpidem, others note its broader function in drug metabolism. There are no direct contradictions in the provided descriptions, but they collectively reinforce CYP1A2's significance in pharmacogenetics and drug interactions, particularly due to its inhibition by fluvoxamine.  \n\nIn summary, **CYP1A2** is a critical hepatic enzyme responsible for metabolizing several drugs, including R-warfarin and zolpidem, and its activity can be significantly altered by inhibitors such as fluvoxamine. This information underscores its clinical relevance in drug efficacy and safety.\",4\r\n4971,R-华法林,\"R-华法林是华法林的光学异构体之一，主要通过CYP1A2、CYP3A4和CYP2C19代谢。\"\"\",3\r\n5037,氟喹诺酮类,氟喹诺酮类药物，尤其是环丙沙星和依诺沙星，能够抑制CYP1A2，减慢茶碱、咖啡因的代谢>,2\r\n5051,环丙沙星,,2\r\n5049,依诺沙星,依诺沙星是一种氟喹诺酮类药物，能够抑制CYP1A2，减慢茶碱、咖啡因的代谢>,2\r\n5042,咖啡因,\"\n咖啡因是一种物质，其代谢可被氟喹诺酮类药物抑制>\",4\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n5359,氟伏沙明,茶碱,氟伏沙明强烈抑制 CYP1A2，显著减慢茶碱的代谢,15\r\n5245,CYP1A2,R-华法林,R-华法林主要通过CYP1A2代谢。,7\r\n5366,氟喹诺酮类,茶碱,氟喹诺酮类药物抑制CYP1A2，减慢茶碱的代谢，可能造成茶碱中毒,6\r\n5379,茶碱,环丙沙星,环丙沙星抑制茶碱代谢，可能导致中毒,6\r\n5380,茶碱,依诺沙星,依诺沙星抑制茶碱代谢，可能导致中毒,6\r\n5381,咖啡因,环丙沙星,环丙沙星抑制咖啡因代谢,6\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
