It is notably involved in the breakdown of **irbesartan**, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) used as an antihypertensive, as well as **S-warfarin**, a key anticoagulant. The enzyme's activity is essential for determining the efficacy and safety of these medications, as variations in CYP2C9 function can significantly alter drug clearance rates.  \n\nCYP2C9 is also subject to inhibition by certain compounds, which can reduce its metabolic activity. This inhibition is particularly clinically relevant for drugs like warfarin, where decreased CYP2C9 activity can lead to prolonged anticoagulant effects and an increased risk of bleeding. The enzyme's role in warfarin metabolism is well-documented, with genetic polymorphisms and drug interactions influencing its function.  \n\nThe descriptions highlight CYP2C9's dual involvement in metabolizing both antihypertensive and anticoagulant drugs, emphasizing its importance in pharmacogenomics and personalized medicine. While some descriptions focus on specific substrates (e.g., irbesartan or warfarin), others underscore its broader role in drug metabolism and susceptibility to inhibitors. There are no direct contradictions, but the combined information clarifies that CYP2C9 has multiple drug substrates and its inhibition can have significant clinical consequences, particularly for narrow-therapeutic-index drugs like warfarin.  \n\nIn summary, CYP2C9 is a vital metabolic enzyme with a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of several medications, including irbesartan and warfarin. Its activity can be modulated by inhibitors, and genetic or pharmacological alterations in its function may necessitate dose adjustments to avoid adverse effects.\",14\r\n4974,S-华法林,,1\r\n4878,格列美脲,格列美脲（Glimepiride）是一种口服降糖药，属于磺脲类药物，主要用于治疗2型糖尿病。其药理作用是通过刺激胰腺β细胞释放胰岛素，从而降低血糖水平。格列美脲的代谢主要通过肝脏中的细胞色素P450酶CYP2C9进行，因此其药效和代谢速率可能受到CYP2C9抑制剂或诱导剂的影响。例如，与CYP2C9抑制剂合用时，可能导致格列美脲代谢减慢，血药浓度升高，增加低血糖风险；而与CYP2C9诱导剂合用时，则可能加速其代谢，降低疗效。临床使用中需注意药物相互作用，并根据患者情况调整剂量以确保安全性和有效性。,1\r\n4880,格列吡嗪,格列吡嗪（Glipizide）是一种口服降糖药，属于磺脲类药物，主要通过肝脏中的CYP2C9酶代谢。其药理作用是通过刺激胰腺β细胞释放胰岛素来降低血糖水平。由于格列吡嗪的代谢高度依赖CYP2C9，因此与CYP2C9抑制剂（如氟康唑、胺碘酮等）合用时可能减缓其代谢，增加低血糖风险；而与CYP2C9诱导剂（如利福平、苯妥英钠等）合用时则可能加速代谢，降低疗效。临床使用中需注意药物相互作用，必要时调整剂量或监测血糖。该药物适用于2型糖尿病患者的血糖控制，尤其对饮食和运动疗法效果不佳者有效。,1\r\n5102,巴比妥类,巴比妥类 is an inducer of CYP2C9,1\r\n4877,格列本脲,\"格列本脲（Glibenclamide）是一种口服降糖药，属于磺脲类药物，主要用于治疗糖尿病。其药理作用是通过刺激胰腺β细胞释放胰岛素来降低血糖水平。格列本脲主要通过肝脏中的CYP2C9酶代谢，因此其代谢过程可能受到CYP2C9抑制剂或诱导剂的影响。例如，与CYP2C9抑制剂（如克拉霉素）合用可能导致格列本脲代谢减慢，从而增加其血药浓度，引发低血糖风险。  \n\n此外，格列本脲与其他药物的相互作用需特别注意，尤其是那些影响CYP2C9活性的药物。临床使用时需密切监测血糖水平，以避免潜在的药物相互作用导致的不良反应。综上，格列本脲是一种有效的降糖药物，但其代谢依赖CYP2C9，因此联合用药时应谨慎评估风险。\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n5484,那格列奈,CYP3A4,那格列奈 is metabolized by CYP3A4,62\r\n5218,卡马西平,CYP450,卡马西平 induces CYP450 enzyme activity,16\r\n5244,CYP2C9,S-华法林,S-华法林主要通过CYP2C9代谢。,15\r\n5454,CYP2C9,格列美脲,格列美脲 is metabolized by CYP2C9,15\r\n5456,CYP2C9,格列吡嗪,格列吡嗪 is metabolized by CYP2C9,15\r\n5463,CYP2C9,巴比妥类,巴比妥类 induces CYP2C9,15\r\n5166,格列本脲,克拉霉素,格列本脲与克拉霉素合用可能导致低血糖,11\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
