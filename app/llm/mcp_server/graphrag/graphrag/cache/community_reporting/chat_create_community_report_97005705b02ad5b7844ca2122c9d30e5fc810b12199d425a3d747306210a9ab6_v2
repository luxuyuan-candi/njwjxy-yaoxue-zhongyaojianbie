They function by increasing serotonin levels in the brain, which helps alleviate symptoms of depression and other mood disorders.  \n\nSSRIs are frequently considered for use during pregnancy, though certain precautions apply. While most SSRIs are generally not associated with fetal heart disease or death, paroxetine is an exception, as it may increase the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. As a result, healthcare providers often avoid prescribing paroxetine to pregnant patients, opting for alternative SSRIs when necessary.  \n\nOverall, SSRIs remain a cornerstone in depression treatment due to their efficacy and relatively favorable safety profile, though individual patient factors—such as pregnancy—require careful consideration when selecting the appropriate medication.\",16\r\n5263,SNRIS,\"**Summary of SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors):**  \n\nSNRIs, or Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors, are a class of antidepressant medications primarily used for the treatment of depression. They function by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, two neurotransmitters associated with mood regulation. SNRIs are widely recognized as an effective pharmacological option for managing depressive disorders.  \n\nWhile SNRIs are commonly prescribed for depression, some studies suggest they may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous miscarriage, though further research is needed to fully understand this potential risk. The class is also referred to by alternative names, including \"\"Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors\"\" and \"\"Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors,\"\" all of which describe the same group of medications.  \n\nIn summary, SNRIs are a well-established class of antidepressants with a primary role in depression treatment, though their use may carry certain risks that warrant careful consideration, particularly in specific populations such as pregnant individuals.\",12\r\n5001,帕罗西汀,\"**帕罗西汀 (Paroxetine)** 是一种选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（SSRI）类抗抑郁药，常用剂量范围为20~50mg/d。它在治疗伴有焦虑症状的抑郁症方面更具优势，但可能引起较明显的抗胆碱能副作用（如口干、便秘）和镇静作用。  \n\n帕罗西汀通过抑制CYP2D6酶代谢，可能影响其他依赖该酶代谢的药物（如某些抗心律失常药或抗精神病药），导致药物相互作用风险增加。此外，与单胺氧化酶抑制剂（如司来吉兰/selegiline）联用时可能引发严重反应（如5-羟色胺综合征），需严格避免联合用药。  \n\n在特定人群中需谨慎使用，例如卒中后抑郁患者，因其可能增加心血管风险（如血压波动或心律失常）。总体而言，帕罗西汀是一种有效的SSRI抗抑郁药，但需综合考虑其药物相互作用、副作用及个体患者情况后调整用药方案。  \n\n（注：描述整合了中英文资料，确保信息一致性，未保留重复或矛盾内容。）\",16\r\n4935,CYP2D6,\"**CYP2D6** is a crucial metabolic enzyme primarily involved in the metabolism of a wide variety of drugs, including beta-blockers and other pharmaceuticals. It plays a significant role in drug interactions by influencing the rates at which certain medications are metabolized, thereby affecting their efficacy and safety. CYP2D6 is known to be inhibited by specific compounds, such as paroxetine (帕罗西汀), which can alter its enzymatic activity and impact drug processing.  \n\nAs a key enzyme in drug metabolism, CYP2D6 contributes to individual variability in drug response, making it an important consideration in pharmacogenomics. Its function can be modulated by inhibitors, leading to potential changes in the pharmacokinetics of co-administered drugs. The enzyme's activity is essential for the proper breakdown and elimination of many therapeutic agents, underscoring its clinical relevance in personalized medicine.  \n\nIn summary, CYP2D6 is a vital metabolic enzyme with a broad role in drug metabolism, influenced by inhibitors like paroxetine, and contributes significantly to drug interaction dynamics. Its function is critical for determining drug efficacy and safety across diverse patient populations.\",7\r\n4959,氟西汀,\"**氟西汀（Fluoxetine）**是一种选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（SSRI）类抗抑郁药物，主要通过肝脏细胞色素P450酶CYP2D6代谢。作为CYP2D6的底物，氟西汀同时对该酶具有显著抑制作用，可能影响其他依赖此酶代谢的药物，导致其代谢减慢或血药浓度升高。例如，氟西汀会延缓β受体阻滞剂美托洛尔（Metoprolol）和镇咳药右美沙芬（Dextromethorphan）的代谢，从而增加这些药物的作用时间和潜在不良反应风险。此外，氟西汀禁止与单胺氧化酶抑制剂（MAOI）联用，因两者合用可能引发5-羟色胺综合征，表现为高热、意识障碍和自主神经功能紊乱等严重反应。  \n\n综上，氟西汀在临床应用中需注意其药物相互作用特性，尤其是对CYP2D6的抑制效应及与MAOIs的禁忌配伍，以确保用药安全性。\",14\r\n5018,艾司西酞普兰,Escitalopram is an SSRI antidepressant,7\r\n5024,5-羟色胺综合征,5-羟色胺综合征是一种严重的药物不良反应或药物相互作用事件，主要由体内5-羟色胺（血清素）水平过高引起。该综合征通常发生在同时使用多种增加5-羟色胺活性的药物（如抗抑郁药、阿片类药物或兴奋剂）时，导致中枢和外周神经系统过度兴奋。其临床表现包括精神状态改变、自主神经功能紊乱（如心动过速、高血压、高热）以及神经肌肉异常（如震颤、反射亢进、肌阵挛）。若不及时治疗，5-羟色胺综合征可能危及生命。因此，早期识别和干预至关重要。尽管描述中分别强调了“药物不良反应”和“药物相互作用事件”，但两者本质上是关联的，均指向因药物作用导致的5-羟色胺系统功能紊乱。,4\r\n4958,美托洛尔,\"**美托洛尔（Metoprolol）** 是一种β受体阻滞剂（beta-blocker），主要用于治疗高血压、心绞痛和心律失常等心血管疾病。其药效可能受到其他药物的影响，尤其是通过细胞色素P450酶CYP2D6代谢途径的相互作用。  \n\n美托洛尔与某些药物合用时需特别注意：  \n1. **CYP2D6抑制剂（如氟西汀、帕罗西汀）**：这些药物可能抑制美托洛尔的代谢，导致其血药浓度升高，从而增强药效或增加不良反应风险。  \n2. **普罗帕酮**：与美托洛尔联用可能进一步抑制CYP2D6活性，加剧美托洛尔的血药浓度升高，并增加心动过缓或低血压等不良反应的风险。  \n3. **维拉帕米**：作为钙通道阻滞剂，与美托洛尔合用时可能协同抑制心脏传导系统，加重心动过缓或低血压等副作用。  \n\n综上，美托洛尔的药效和安全性易受合并用药影响，尤其是与CYP2D6抑制剂、普罗帕酮或维拉帕米联用时需密切监测。临床使用时应根据患者情况调整剂量，以避免潜在的不良反应。\",4\r\n5021,亚甲蓝,亚甲蓝是一种药物，属于非选择性MAOI类,2\r\n5284,卒中后抑郁,\"Post-stroke depression, a condition affecting 30%-40% of stroke survivors, impacting rehabilitation and cognitive function\",7\r\n4999,西酞普兰,\"**西酞普兰（Citalopram）** 是一种选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（SSRIs）类抗抑郁药，主要用于治疗抑郁症，尤其适用于伴有焦虑症状的患者。其常用剂量范围为20~40毫克/天（mg/d）。常见的不良反应包括恶心、呕吐、消化不良等胃肠道症状。  \n\n需要注意的是，西酞普兰与其他影响血清素水平的药物（如司来吉兰（selegiline））联用时，可能增加血清素综合征的风险。血清素综合征是一种严重的药物不良反应，表现为高热、意识模糊、震颤等症状，需谨慎用药并密切监测。  \n\n综上，西酞普兰是一种有效的抗抑郁药，但使用时需注意剂量控制和药物相互作用，以避免不良反应的发生。\",11\r\n5025,房室传导阻滞,房室传导阻滞是一种心脏传导系统异常,1\r\n5026,心动过缓,心动过缓是一种心率过慢的心脏症状,1\r\n5027,他莫昔芬,他莫昔芬是一种抗肿瘤药，经 CYP2D6 代谢为重要的活性代谢物 endoxifen,1\r\n5269,5-HT REGULATOR,\"5-hydroxytryptamine regulator, a class of antidepressant medications\",1\r\n5283,PAROXETINE,,1\r\n5286,质子泵抑制剂,Gastric protective agents recommended when combining SSRIs with anticoagulants/antiplatelets,1\r\n5264,NASSA,\"Noradrenergic and Specific Serotonergic Antidepressants, a class of antidepressants\nNoradrenergic and Specific Serotonergic Antidepressants - a class of antidepressant medications\",4\r\n5028,右美沙芬,右美沙芬是一种药物，与氟西汀合用时可能导致5-羟色胺能神经作用和不良反应,1\r\n5000,舍曲林,\"**舍曲林（Sertraline）** 是一种选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（SSRI）类抗抑郁药，广泛用于治疗抑郁症及相关症状。其常用剂量范围为50~200毫克/天（50~200mg/d），在临床应用中展现出较好的疗效与耐受性平衡，同时可能对认知功能有一定的改善作用。舍曲林被推荐用于治疗卒中后抑郁（post-stroke depression），但其使用需谨慎，尤其是与其他药物联用时。例如，与司来吉兰（selegiline）等药物合并使用可能导致严重不良反应，因此需严格遵循医嘱以避免潜在风险。  \n\n综上所述，舍曲林作为SSRI类抗抑郁药，在抑郁症治疗中具有重要地位，但其安全性和药物相互作用需引起重视。\",8\r\n5265,TCAS,\"Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) are a traditional class of antidepressant medications historically used to treat depression but now primarily prescribed as a second-line treatment due to their side effect profile and the availability of newer alternatives. TCAs are known for their significant anticholinergic effects, which can cause dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and urinary retention, as well as their potential for cardiac toxicity, including arrhythmias and hypotension. These risks make them generally unsuitable for elderly patients, who are more vulnerable to such adverse effects.  \n\nDespite their drawbacks, TCAs remain an important option in certain cases, particularly when other treatments have failed. They work by inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine, though their mechanism is less selective than that of newer antidepressants such as SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors). While their use has declined in favor of safer alternatives, TCAs continue to be relevant in specific clinical scenarios, underscoring their enduring role in psychiatric treatment.  \n\nThe descriptions consistently highlight TCAs as a well-established but secondary option in modern antidepressant therapy, emphasizing their efficacy alongside their notable side effects and risks. No major contradictions exist among the provided descriptions, as all agree on their classification, historical significance, and current status as a second-line treatment.\",7\r\n5266,MAOIS,\"**MAOIs (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors)** are a traditional class of antidepressant medications used to treat depression. They work by inhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which breaks down neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, thereby increasing their availability in the brain. MAOIs are considered an older class of antidepressants but remain effective for certain patients, particularly those who do not respond to other treatments.  \n\nHowever, MAOIs have significant dietary and drug interaction restrictions. Notably, they should not be combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram, due to the risk of serotonin syndrome—a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin levels. Additionally, MAOIs require strict adherence to dietary guidelines to avoid interactions with tyramine-rich foods (e.g., aged cheeses, cured meats), which can lead to dangerous increases in blood pressure.  \n\nDespite these limitations, MAOIs remain a valuable option in psychiatric treatment, particularly for treatment-resistant depression. Their use is carefully monitored to ensure patient safety.\",6\r\n5270,NDRI,\"Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, a class of antidepressant medications\",1\r\n5281,MIRTAZAPINE,An antidepressant that may improve sleep in elderly patients but may be associated with spontaneous miscarriage risk,1\r\n5282,VENLAFAXINE,An SNRI antidepressant that requires blood pressure monitoring in elderly patients due to hypertensive effects,1\r\n5004,SSRI,Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a class of drugs used to treat depression and anxiety disorders,4\r\n5280,NMPA,\"National Medical Products Administration, which provides safety classifications for antidepressant use during pregnancy\",4\r\n4960,普罗帕酮,\"普罗帕酮是一种Ⅰc类抗心律失常药物，主要用于治疗心律失常。其药理作用包括抑制心脏钠通道，从而减缓心肌细胞的电信号传导。此外，普罗帕酮还表现出对肝脏细胞色素P450酶系统（尤其是CYP2D6酶）的抑制作用，这一特性可能导致与其他药物的相互作用。  \n\n当与帕罗西汀（一种抗抑郁药）合用时，普罗帕酮可能抑制帕罗西汀的代谢，导致其血药浓度升高，增加不良反应的风险。类似地，普罗帕酮与美托洛尔（一种β受体阻滞剂）合用时，会通过抑制CYP2D6酶而减慢美托洛尔的代谢，从而提高其血药浓度，可能增强美托洛尔的药理作用或副作用。  \n\n综合来看，普罗帕酮不仅具有抗心律失常的作用，还可能通过抑制CYP2D6酶影响其他药物的代谢，因此在临床使用中需注意潜在的药物相互作用，必要时调整剂量或监测血药浓度以避免不良反应。\",3\r\n4076,PROPRANOLOL,\"Propranolol (Inderal) is a beta-blocker antihypertensive drug whose absorption can be reduced by bile acid binding resins\"\"\",2\r\n5271,AMITRIPTYLINE,\"A tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) used to treat anxiety and depression, with common side effects like arrhythmia and dry mouth\"\"\",4\r\n5279,TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS (TCAS),,5\r\n1020,NATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION,,4\r\n4158,DIACYLGLYCEROL OIL,,4\r\n4151,FDA,\"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a federal regulatory agency responsible for overseeing the safety, efficacy, and security of food, drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and other consumer products in the United States.

This inhibition slows the metabolism of certain drugs, such as metoprolol, which relies on CYP2D6 for its breakdown. As a result, concurrent use of 普罗帕酮 with medications metabolized by CYP2D6, like metoprolol, may lead to increased plasma concentrations and prolonged effects of those drugs. Both descriptions confirm that 普罗帕酮 acts as a CYP2D6 inhibitor, though one specifically mentions its impact on metoprolol metabolism while the other broadly states its enzyme-inhibiting effect. The combined summary clarifies that 普罗帕酮's inhibition of CYP2D6 can influence the pharmacokinetics of substrates like metoprolol, potentially necessitating dose adjustments or monitoring in clinical settings.  \n\n(Word count: 120)\",10\r\n5709,MAOIS,5-羟色胺综合征,MAOIs are strongly associated with causing serotonin syndrome,10\r\n5191,CYP2D6,PROPRANOLOL,Propranolol is metabolized by CYP2D6,9\r\n5721,AMITRIPTYLINE,TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS (TCAS),Amitriptyline is a member of the tricyclic antidepressants class,9\r\n4212,NATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION,DIACYLGLYCEROL OIL,The National Health Commission revised quality standards for diacylglycerol oil in 2021,8\r\n4213,FDA,DIACYLGLYCEROL OIL,The FDA listed diacylglycerol oil as a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) substance in 2000,8\r\n5480,CYP2D6,西咪替汀,西咪替汀 inhibits CYP2D6,8\r\n5722,CLOMIPRAMINE,TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS (TCAS),Clomipramine is a member of the tricyclic antidepressants class,7\r\n5723,DOSULEPIN,TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS (TCAS),Dosulepin is a member of the tricyclic antidepressants class,7\r\n4211,NATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION,MINISTRY OF HEALTH,\"The National Health Commission revised the quality requirements for diacylglycerol oil, which was initially approved by the Ministry of Health in 2009\",6\r\n4215,MINISTRY OF HEALTH,DIACYLGLYCEROL OIL,The Ministry of Health approved diacylglycerol oil as a new food ingredient in 2009,6\r\n5368,利奈唑胺,单胺类药物,利奈唑胺与单胺类药物合用可能导致5-羟色胺综合征,6\r\n5369,利奈唑胺,5-羟色胺能药物,利奈唑胺与5-羟色胺能药物合用可能导致5-羟色胺综合征,6\r\n5370,利奈唑胺,麦角碱类,合用可能导致5-羟色胺综合征,6\r\n5718,AMITRIPTYLINE,CLOMIPRAMINE,Both are tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) with similar pharmacological effects and side effects,6\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
