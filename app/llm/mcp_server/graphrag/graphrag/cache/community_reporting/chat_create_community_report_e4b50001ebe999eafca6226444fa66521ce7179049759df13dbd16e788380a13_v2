Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\r\n1993,DYSLIPIDEMIA,\"**DYSLIPIDEMIA**  \n\nDyslipidemia is a disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by abnormal levels of lipids in the blood, including elevated cholesterol and/or triglycerides. It is diagnosed through measurements of cholesterol (such as LDL, HDL) and triglyceride levels. The condition is a significant risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and is frequently associated with other comorbidities, particularly hypertension. Dyslipidemia often coexists with hypertension, emphasizing the need for integrated management of both conditions to reduce cardiovascular risk.  \n\nThe disorder is commonly observed in elderly patients, who may present with multiple metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. Dyslipidemia involves disruptions in lipoprotein metabolism, contributing to its classification as a major contributor to cardiovascular disease. Management typically focuses on lipid-lowering strategies, including lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions, to mitigate associated risks.  \n\nWhile descriptions vary slightly in emphasis—some highlighting its diagnostic criteria, others its association with hypertension or cardiovascular risk—the core definition remains consistent: Dyslipidemia is an abnormal lipid profile requiring medical attention to prevent complications, particularly in high-risk populations. The condition underscores the importance of regular screening and proactive management in patients with or at risk for metabolic and cardiovascular disorders.\",13\r\n3260,ACUTE PANCREATITIS,\"**ACUTE PANCREATITIS** is a serious inflammatory condition affecting the pancreas, often characterized by sudden onset and severe symptoms. One of the key triggers of this condition is **severe hypertriglyceridemia**, or abnormally high levels of triglycerides in the blood. Elevated triglyceride levels can lead to the development of acute pancreatitis, underscoring the importance of managing lipid levels to prevent this potentially life-threatening disorder. The descriptions provided consistently highlight the association between high triglycerides and acute pancreatitis, emphasizing it as a significant causative factor.  \n\nIn summary, **ACUTE PANCREATITIS** is an inflammatory pancreatic disorder that can arise due to metabolic disturbances, particularly **hypertriglyceridemia**. Proper monitoring and control of triglyceride levels are crucial in mitigating the risk of this condition.\",2\r\n2387,HIGH TRIGLYCERIDES,\"**HIGH TRIGLYCERIDES**  \n\nHigh triglycerides, also known as hypertriglyceridemia, is a type of hyperlipidemia characterized by elevated levels of triglycerides (TG) in the blood, specifically defined as a serum triglyceride concentration of **1.7 mmol/L or higher**. This condition is associated with an increased risk of several health complications, including **acute pancreatitis**, **diabetes mellitus**, and **bile duct obstruction**.  \n\nThe primary diagnostic threshold for high triglycerides is consistent across descriptions, with both sources agreeing on the **1.7 mmol/L cutoff**. Elevated triglyceride levels can result from genetic factors, poor dietary habits (such as excessive intake of sugars and fats), obesity, insulin resistance, or other metabolic disorders. If left unmanaged, persistently high triglycerides may contribute to cardiovascular diseases and other metabolic syndromes.  \n\nWhile the descriptions emphasize slightly different complications, they are not contradictory but rather complementary. The first highlights the general definition of the condition, while the second underscores its potential severe consequences, particularly **acute pancreatitis**, a life-threatening condition that can arise from extremely high triglyceride levels.  \n\nIn summary, **high triglycerides** is a clinically significant lipid disorder with a well-defined diagnostic threshold (≥1.7 mmol/L) and notable associations with metabolic and pancreatic health risks. Management typically involves lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes and increased physical activity, along with pharmacological interventions when necessary.\",6\r\n3308,BILE DUCT OBSTRUCTION,\"Bile duct obstruction can be caused by high triglyceride levels.\"\"\",1\r\n3311,HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA,\"Hypertriglyceridemia is characterized by elevated triglyceride levels and can be genetic or lifestyle-related\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1633,DYSLIPIDEMIA,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE,Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease,34\r\n2820,FAMILIAL HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA,ACUTE PANCREATITIS,Severe hypertriglyceridemia can trigger acute pancreatitis,8\r\n2924,HIGH TRIGLYCERIDES,ACUTE PANCREATITIS,High triglycerides can lead to acute pancreatitis.,8\r\n2925,HIGH TRIGLYCERIDES,BILE DUCT OBSTRUCTION,High triglycerides can lead to bile duct obstruction.,7\r\n2927,HIGH TRIGLYCERIDES,HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA,Hypertriglyceridemia causes high triglyceride levels,7\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
