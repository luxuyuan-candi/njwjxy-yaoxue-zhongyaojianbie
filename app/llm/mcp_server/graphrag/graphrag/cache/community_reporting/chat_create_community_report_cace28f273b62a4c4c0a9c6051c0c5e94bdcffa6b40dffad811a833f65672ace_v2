Clinical findings include active bowel sounds and the absence of abdominal tenderness or masses. It is classified under ICD-11 with the code **DD91.2**.  \n\n**Functional Dyspepsia (FDr)**, on the other hand, is a gastrointestinal disorder with an unclear etiology. Potential contributing factors include gastrointestinal motility abnormalities, heightened visceral sensitivity, intestinal flora imbalance, food allergies or intolerances, and psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, and depression.  \n\nWhile both conditions share the abbreviation \"\"FDr,\"\" they represent separate clinical entities with distinct diagnostic criteria and pathophysiological mechanisms. Functional Diarrhea primarily involves altered bowel habits without pain, whereas Functional Dyspepsia is associated with upper gastrointestinal symptoms and multifactorial causes. The term \"\"FDR\"\" should be clarified based on clinical context to avoid confusion between these two conditions.  \n\nThis summary reconciles the provided descriptions by distinguishing between the two disorders while acknowledging their shared medical and research framework.\",25\r\n1465,CT,\"**Computed Tomography (CT)** is a diagnostic imaging technique used to visualize internal organs and structures in the human body. It is widely employed in medical settings to diagnose a variety of conditions by generating detailed cross-sectional images of tissues, bones, and blood vessels. While CT scans are highly effective for many diagnostic purposes, they are less effective than Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in detecting chronic bleeding and cerebrovascular malformations. Despite this limitation, CT remains a valuable tool in clinical practice due to its speed, accessibility, and ability to provide clear images of complex anatomical structures.  \n\nIn summary, CT is a versatile medical imaging technique with broad diagnostic applications, though its effectiveness varies depending on the clinical context, particularly when compared to MRI for certain neurological conditions.\",2\r\n1587,八段锦,八段锦（Baduanjin）是一种中国传统健身运动，被推荐作为高血压患者（FDr患者）的适宜体育活动之一。该运动结合舒缓的动作、呼吸调节和身心放松，具有缓解压力、调整情绪的作用。研究表明，规律练习八段锦（每周3至5次，每次30分钟）有助于降低血压、改善血脂水平，同时对心血管健康产生积极影响。作为低强度有氧运动，八段锦适合不同年龄段和健康状况的人群，尤其适合慢性病患者作为日常康复锻炼的一部分。其传统养生理念与现代医学建议相结合，体现了中西医协同的健康管理方式。,2\r\n1462,ICD-11,\"The International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11), is a global standard for diagnostic health information.\"\"\",1\r\n1463,X线钡灌肠,\"X-ray barium enema is a diagnostic procedure used to examine the colon and rectum for abnormalities such as tumors, polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease.\"\"\",1\r\n1464,肠镜,\"Colonoscopy is a diagnostic procedure used to examine the colon and rectum for abnormalities such as tumors, polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease.\"\"\",1\r\n1466,PET,\"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a diagnostic imaging technique used to visualize metabolic processes in the body.\"\"\",1\r\n1566,四君子汤,\"A traditional Chinese medicine formula used as a base treatment for FDr, often combined with other symptoms for辨证加减 (syndrome differentiation and modification).\"\"\",1\r\n1567,理中汤,\"Another traditional Chinese medicine formula used as a base treatment for FDr, often combined with other symptoms for辨证加减 (syndrome differentiation and modification).\"\"\",1\r\n1568,艾灸,\"A traditional Chinese medicine therapy involving moxibustion at specific acupuncture points like Shenque, Qihai, Tianshu, Guanyuan, and Zusanli to treat FDr.\"\"\",1\r\n1569,针刺,\"A traditional Chinese medicine therapy involving acupuncture at points like Zhongwan, Tianshu, Guanyuan, and Zusanli, adjusted based on patient's syndrome differentiation.\"\"\",1\r\n1570,穴位贴敷,\"A traditional Chinese medicine therapy involving herbal patches applied to acupuncture points, such as using modified antidiarrheal powder for spleen-stomach deficiency FDr.\"\"\",1\r\n1595,中医药循证医学,,1\r\n1586,五禽戏,\"A traditional Chinese exercise similar to Tai Chi, mentioned as part of the recommended physical activities for FDr patients.\"\"\",1\r\n1589,导引术,\"A traditional Chinese exercise therapy mentioned as part of the recommended physical activities.\"\"\",1\r\n1592,太白,\"An acupressure point mentioned for home massage therapy in FDr treatment.\"\"\",1\r\n1594,神阙穴,\"An acupressure point mentioned for home massage therapy in FDr treatment.\"\"\",1\r\n1147,MRI,\"**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** is a diagnostic medical imaging technique used to visualize internal organs and structures in detail. It is particularly valuable for examining soft tissues, making it a critical tool in diagnosing a variety of conditions. MRI is employed in the assessment of **primary aldosteronism** and **pheochromocytoma complications** in hypertensive patients, aiding in the identification of adrenal gland abnormalities. Additionally, it is highly effective in detecting **chronic bleeding** and **cerebrovascular malformations**, providing detailed insights into vascular and neurological disorders.  \n\nAs a non-invasive imaging modality, MRI utilizes magnetic fields and radio waves to generate high-resolution images, offering superior contrast between different tissues compared to other techniques like CT scans. Its versatility makes it indispensable in neurology, cardiology, oncology, and musculoskeletal imaging. By combining anatomical and functional information, MRI supports accurate diagnosis and treatment planning across multiple medical specialties.  \n\nIn summary, MRI serves as a comprehensive imaging solution for both structural and functional evaluation, with applications ranging from endocrine disorders (e.g., adrenal tumors) to cerebrovascular and neurological conditions.
