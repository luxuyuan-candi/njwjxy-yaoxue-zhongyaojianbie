It is defined by systolic blood pressure ≥180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥120 mmHg and necessitates urgent treatment to reduce blood pressure safely. This condition is particularly dangerous in pregnant women, where it poses significant risks to both the mother and fetus, demanding prompt and aggressive management to avoid life-threatening complications. The primary goal in managing hypertensive emergencies is rapid but controlled blood pressure reduction to safeguard organ function.\",9\n1528,URAPIDIL,\"**URAPIDIL** is an intravenous antihypertensive medication primarily used in emergency settings for severe hypertension or hypertensive crises, including during pregnancy. It is also employed to manage blood pressure in patients with acute ischemic stroke prior to treatment. Urapidil serves as a rapid-acting therapeutic option for acute hypertensive conditions, ensuring prompt control of elevated blood pressure in critical situations.  \n\nThe summary consolidates all provided descriptions, highlighting its use in hypertensive emergencies (including pregnancy-related cases) and acute ischemic stroke, while resolving any apparent contradictions by emphasizing its broader applicability in urgent hypertensive scenarios.\",5\n1525,LABETALOL,\"**LABETALOL** is a medication that functions as both an alpha and beta-blocker, used primarily for controlling blood pressure in various clinical settings. It is administered both orally and intravenously as an antihypertensive drug, including during pregnancy, though it may carry potential side effects such as fetal bradycardia and skin itching. Additionally, labetalol is employed in managing blood pressure in acute ischemic stroke patients prior to treatment. Its dual mechanism of action, combining alpha and beta blockade, makes it effective for rapid blood pressure control in critical conditions. Overall, labetalol serves as a versatile therapeutic agent for hypertension across different patient populations and medical scenarios.\",6\n1529,PHENTOLAMINE,\"**Phentolamine** is an intravenous alpha-blocker medication primarily used for blood pressure control in hypertensive emergencies, including those occurring during pregnancy. It functions by blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors, leading to vasodilation and a subsequent reduction in blood pressure. The drug is specifically indicated for acute hypertensive crises where rapid blood pressure management is required.\",2\n1530,NITROGLYCERIN,\"Nitroglycerin is an intravenous vasodilator medication primarily used for blood pressure control in hypertensive emergencies, including severe hypertension or hypertensive crises during pregnancy. It functions by dilating blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure and alleviating acute hypertensive conditions. The medication is administered intravenously to ensure rapid and precise dosing in critical situations.\",2\n1130,NICARDIPINE,\"**NICARDIPINE** is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB) primarily used for the treatment of hypertension and acute blood pressure control. It is administered intravenously, making it particularly effective in urgent medical scenarios. Nicardipine is indicated for managing high blood pressure in various critical conditions, including acute ischemic stroke patients prior to treatment and pregnant women requiring rapid blood pressure stabilization. As a calcium channel blocker, it works by relaxing blood vessels, thereby reducing vascular resistance and lowering blood pressure. Its intravenous formulation allows for precise and immediate control in acute settings. Overall, Nicardipine serves as a versatile antihypertensive agent in both emergency and non-emergency clinical contexts.\",6\n1887,ACUTE HEMORRHAGIC STROKE,A medical condition requiring careful blood pressure management in the acute phase,1\n1888,SEVERE PREECLAMPSIA,A pregnancy complication requiring rapid blood pressure control,1\n1889,CATECHOLAMINE CRISIS,A medical emergency requiring rapid blood pressure control,1\n1196,METHYLDOPA,\"Methyldopa is a centrally acting drug used for hypertension with a dosage range of 250-1000 mg and a half-life of 2 hours\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2156,HYPERTENSION,ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE,\"Hypertension can lead to acute ischemic stroke, and managing blood pressure is crucial in treating this condition\",187\n1569,HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY,URAPIDIL,Urapidil is an intravenous option for hypertensive emergencies in pregnancy,14\n1573,LABETALOL,NIFEDIPINE,Both are commonly used antihypertensive drugs for treating hypertension in pregnancy,12\n1571,HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY,PHENTOLAMINE,Phentolamine is an alpha-blocker used for acute hypertension management,11\n1572,HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY,NITROGLYCERIN,Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator option for critical blood pressure reduction,11\n2167,URAPIDIL,LABETALOL,Both Urapidil and Labetalol are used for controlling blood pressure in acute ischemic stroke patients before treatment,11\n2172,NICARDIPINE,ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE,Nicardipine is used for blood pressure control in acute ischemic stroke patients,10\n2191,ACUTE HEMORRHAGIC STROKE,HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY,Acute hemorrhagic stroke may present as a hypertensive emergency,10\n2192,SEVERE PREECLAMPSIA,HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY,Severe preeclampsia is a form of hypertensive emergency,10\n2194,CATECHOLAMINE CRISIS,HYPERTENSIVE EMERGENCY,Catecholamine crisis presents as a hypertensive emergency,10\n1574,LABETALOL,METHYLDOPA,Both are antihypertensive medications recommended for use during pregnancy,7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
