It is recognized as a potential adverse effect of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), particularly spironolactone, though this risk can be mitigated by the use of finerenone. Additionally, hyperkalemia serves as a contraindication for the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), as these medications may exacerbate elevated potassium levels. Thus, managing hyperkalemia is critical when prescribing MRAs, ARBs, or ACEIs to ensure patient safety.\",4\n1280,盐皮质激素受体拮抗剂(MRA),\"盐皮质激素受体拮抗剂(MRA)包括螺内酯和依普利酮，用于阻断MR过度激活，降低血压、保护心肾功能。\"\"\",5\n1746,PRA,\"**PRA (Plasma Renin Activity)** is a clinical measurement used to assess the activity of the renin enzyme in the blood. It serves as a key diagnostic tool in evaluating conditions such as **aldosteronism**, where it helps determine the effectiveness of **mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) treatment** in patients. PRA provides insights into the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) by quantifying renin's enzymatic activity, aiding in the diagnosis and management of hypertension and related disorders. The test is particularly valuable in differentiating primary from secondary causes of hyperaldosteronism and guiding therapeutic decisions.  \n\n*(Note: Contradictions were not present in the provided descriptions, so the summary consolidates all details into a coherent overview.)*\",2\n1278,MRA,\"**Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists (MRA)** are a class of non-steroidal medications that act as selective antagonists of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), with high affinity and specificity for MR and low affinity for androgen, glucocorticoid, progesterone, and estrogen receptors, thereby minimizing adverse effects. MRAs are primarily used to treat **primary aldosteronism**, where they serve as a first-line therapy, as well as **heart failure** (particularly **HFrEF**), where they improve prognosis, reduce hospitalization rates, and lower mortality. Additionally, MRAs are employed in the management of **chronic kidney disease (CKD)** and **diabetic kidney disease**, where they help reduce proteinuria and slow disease progression.  \n\nMRAs are also utilized in **resistant hypertension**, often in combination with other antihypertensive agents, to effectively lower blood pressure. However, their use may be associated with side effects such as **hyperkalemia** (especially in CKD patients), **male gynecomastia**, and **sexual dysfunction**. Newer MRAs, such as **finerenone**, have been developed specifically for treating diabetic kidney disease, offering targeted therapeutic benefits.  \n\nOverall, MRAs are versatile medications with significant clinical applications in cardiovascular, renal, and endocrine disorders, though careful monitoring is required to mitigate potential adverse effects.\",21\n1284,SPIRONOLACTONE,\"**Spironolactone** is a steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) and aldosterone receptor antagonist primarily used in the treatment of hypertension, particularly in cases of drug-resistant or resistant hypertension, such as in diabetic patients when other treatments fail. It is also effective in managing conditions related to aldosterone excess. Additionally, spironolactone may improve obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) severity and blood pressure. While it serves as a fourth-line treatment for hypertension, its use can be limited by intolerable side effects, prompting the consideration of alternatives like eplerenone. Overall, spironolactone is a versatile medication with applications in hypertension management and potential benefits for OSAS.\",9\n1753,AVS,Adrenal Vein Sampling (AVS) is a diagnostic method for confirming unilateral adrenal aldosterone hypersecretion,2\n1285,EPLERENONE,\"**EPLERENONE** is an aldosterone receptor antagonist primarily used for the treatment of hypertension. It is a steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) that is metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4. Eplerenone serves as an alternative to spironolactone, particularly for patients who cannot tolerate the latter due to adverse effects. Beyond its use in hypertension, eplerenone has been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Its selective action on aldosterone receptors contributes to its efficacy and tolerability profile.\",4\n1286,FINERENONE,\"**Finerenone** is a third-generation, non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) with antifibrotic activity. It is characterized by its balanced tissue distribution between the heart and kidneys, which contributes to improved safety in hyperkalemia compared to older MRAs like spironolactone. Finerenone is approved for cardiorenal protection in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD), specifically for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease. Its unique pharmacological profile makes it a valuable therapeutic option for reducing fibrosis and protecting both cardiac and renal function in this high-risk patient population.\",6\n1123,CYP3A4,\"**CYP3A4** is a metabolic enzyme belonging to the cytochrome P450 3A4 family. It plays a crucial role in the breakdown and metabolism of various drugs, including **eplerenone**, **finerenone**, **verapamil**, and **diltiazem**. Additionally, CYP3A4 can interfere with the metabolism of **chemotherapy drugs**, potentially increasing the risk of toxicity, especially when its activity is inhibited by certain medications. This enzyme's inhibition may lead to elevated levels of chemotherapy agents in the body, heightening adverse effects. Thus, CYP3A4 is a key factor in drug interactions and pharmacokinetics, influencing both therapeutic efficacy and safety.\",6\n1187,螺内酯,\"螺内酯（Spironolactone）是一种非选择性甾体类盐皮质激素受体拮抗剂（MRA），具有多重药理作用及临床用途。作为醛固酮受体的竞争性拮抗剂，它通过抑制盐皮质激素受体发挥作用，主要用于治疗原发性醛固酮增多症（一线治疗药物）和先天性肾上腺增生症相关的高血压。此外，研究显示螺内酯可降低射血分数保留型心力衰竭（HFpEF）患者的住院风险。  \n\n该药物兼具抗雄激素效应，可能引发男性乳腺发育、勃起功能障碍等不良反应。其消除半衰期约为19小时，常规日剂量范围为20-60毫克。尽管螺内酯被归类为利尿剂，但其治疗价值不仅限于利尿作用，还包括对肾素-血管紧张素-醛固酮系统（RAAS）的调节。  \n\n（注：中英文名称并列符合药物文献惯例；矛盾点核查：原描述中\"\"first-line for primary aldosteronism\"\"与\"\"利尿剂\"\"用途无冲突，后者强调机制，前者侧重适应症；不良反应与治疗作用分别归入不同段落以保持逻辑清晰。）\",7\n1188,依普利酮,\"**依普利酮 (Eplerenone)** 是一种甾体类盐皮质激素受体拮抗剂（MRA），通过结构优化显著提高了对盐皮质激素受体（MR）的选择性，但其对MR的亲和力相对较低。作为选择性MR拮抗剂，依普利酮主要用于治疗原发性醛固酮增多症（primary aldosteronism），可作为替代疗法。其药代动力学特征显示，消除半衰期为4-6小时，临床推荐每日剂量范围为25-100毫克。  \n\n该药物通过特异性阻断MR发挥作用，相较于非选择性MRA（如螺内酯），其选择性更高，减少了与其他甾体受体的相互作用，从而可能降低不良反应风险。\",3\n1570,VEGFI,\"**VEGFI (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Inhibitor)** is an anti-tumor drug used in the treatment of cancer. It functions by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor, thereby impeding tumor growth. However, a notable side effect of VEGFI is its potential to induce hypertension. This occurs due to the drug's ability to reduce nitric oxide generation, which plays a role in blood vessel dilation and blood pressure regulation. As a result, VEGFI is also involved in managing hypertension during tumor treatment, highlighting its dual role in both anti-tumor therapy and associated cardiovascular effects.  \n\nThe summary integrates both descriptions, resolving any apparent contradictions by clarifying that VEGFI's hypertension-inducing effect is linked to its mechanism of reducing nitric oxide, which is also why it requires careful blood pressure management in patients undergoing tumor treatment.\",4\n2858,PATHWAY-2 TRIAL,A randomized trial comparing spironolactone with other treatments for resistant hypertension,1\n1576,CHEMOTHERAPY,\"\nCancer treatment that may interact with blood pressure medications>\",3\n1272,沙库巴曲缬沙坦,\"沙库巴曲缬沙坦（Sacubitril/Valsartan）是一种药物，属于首个血管紧张素受体脑啡肽酶抑制剂（ARNI）类药物。它于2021年6月在中国获批用于治疗原发性高血压，同时还适用于心力衰竭（包括HFpEF患者）的治疗。该药物通过抑制脑啡肽酶对利钠肽的降解，发挥利尿、利钠、扩血管以及抗交感神经的作用，从而有效改善心血管功能。  \n\n临床研究表明，沙库巴曲缬沙坦能够显著降低心力衰竭患者（包括HFpEF）的住院风险。此外，它在高血压治疗中也表现出优势，可额外降低诊室收缩压和动态血压，并在特殊人群中显示出更强的降压效果。因此，该药物在心血管疾病领域具有多重治疗价值，既可用于高血压管理，也可改善心力衰竭患者的预后。\",6\n1273,沙库巴曲阿利沙坦,沙库巴曲阿利沙坦是一种正在研发中的血管紧张素受体脑啡肽酶抑制剂（ARNI）类药物，已完成Ⅱ期和Ⅲ期临床试验。作为一种新型降压药，它在Ⅲ期临床试验中表现出比奥美沙坦更强的降压效果，并显示出良好的耐受性。目前，沙库巴曲阿利沙坦仍处于研发阶段，其临床试验数据支持其作为潜在的高效降压药物的前景。,2\n1189,非奈利酮,**非奈利酮**是一种矿物质皮质激素受体拮抗剂（MRA），具有高MR选择性和高MR亲和力的特点，同时也是首个上市的非甾体类MRA。该药物的消除半衰期为2-3小时，推荐每日剂量范围为10-20毫克。其独特的药理特性使其在治疗相关疾病中表现出显著的效果。,2\n1283,醛固酮,\"醛固酮是肾上腺皮质球状带分泌的盐皮质激素，在高血压及相关疾病中发挥重要作用。\"\"\",1\n1413,NON-DIHYDROPYRIDINE CCB,\"The **non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs)** are a class of medications primarily used to treat high blood pressure and heart rhythm disorders.
