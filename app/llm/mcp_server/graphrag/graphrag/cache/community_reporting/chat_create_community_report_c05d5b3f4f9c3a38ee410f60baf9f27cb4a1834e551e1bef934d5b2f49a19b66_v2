It is a long-acting NSAID, typically administered at a dosage of 250 mg three times daily, and has a half-life of 10–18 hours, which allows for sustained relief.  \n\nThe descriptions provided consistently highlight its primary uses—managing pain and reducing inflammation—as well as its availability without a prescription. The slight variation in phrasing (e.g., \"\"Naproxen is an over-the-counter NSAID\"\" vs. \"\"An over-the-counter NSAID\"\") does not introduce contradictions but rather reinforces the same key points.  \n\nIn summary, 萘普生 is a widely accessible NSAID with prolonged effects due to its extended half-life, making it suitable for managing persistent pain and inflammation.
