These inhibitors, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, are used in lipid-lowering treatments, particularly for patients with extremely high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who cannot tolerate other cholesterol-lowering medications. By binding to PCSK9, these inhibitors prevent the degradation of LDL receptors, thereby enhancing the liver's ability to remove LDL-C from the bloodstream. PCSK9 inhibitors represent an important therapeutic option for managing elevated cholesterol levels in high-risk populations. The protein itself is a proprotein convertase, and its inhibition has been shown to significantly reduce LDL-C, contributing to improved cardiovascular outcomes. Overall, PCSK9 serves as a critical target for pharmacological interventions aimed at lowering cholesterol and mitigating cardiovascular risk.\",9\r\n3105,MK?0616,\"MK?0616 is a novel oral PCSK9 inhibitor that lowers LDL-C levels by inhibiting PCSK9 binding to LDL-R, with good efficacy and safety shown in phase 2b clinical trials>\",1\r\n3108,CRISPR?CAS,\"CRISPR-Cas is a gene editing technology that can permanently inhibit disease-causing genes, offering new possibilities for lipid-lowering therapy>\",1\r\n2057,依洛尤单抗,\"依洛尤单抗（Evolocumab）是一种PCSK9抑制剂，主要用于降低胆固醇水平。该药物通过抑制PCSK9蛋白的作用，有效减少低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL-C）的浓度，从而帮助管理高胆固醇血症及相关心血管疾病风险。  \n\n依洛尤单抗的推荐剂量为140毫克，每两周一次，通过皮下注射给药。临床研究表明，该药物具有良好的安全性和耐受性，常见不良反应较轻，主要包括注射部位反应、鼻咽炎和上呼吸道感染等。  \n\n总体而言，依洛尤单抗是一种高效且耐受性良好的降胆固醇药物，适用于需要进一步降低LDL-C水平的患者，尤其是对他汀类药物反应不佳或不耐受的患者。\",4\r\n2058,阿利西尤单抗,\"阿利西尤单抗（Alirocumab）是一种PCSK9抑制剂，主要用于降低胆固醇水平。该药物通过抑制PCSK9蛋白的作用，有效减少低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL-C）的浓度，从而帮助管理高胆固醇血症及相关心血管疾病风险。  \n\n阿利西尤单抗的推荐给药方案为每2周1次皮下注射，每次剂量为75 mg。临床研究表明，该药物具有良好的安全性和耐受性，常见不良反应较轻，主要包括注射部位反应（如疼痛或红肿）以及轻微的流感样症状。  \n\n总体而言，阿利西尤单抗是一种高效且耐受性良好的降胆固醇药物，适用于对他汀类药物反应不足或不耐受的患者，为心血管疾病的预防和治疗提供了重要选择。\",4\r\n2060,英克司兰,\"英克司兰（Inclisiran）是一种小干扰RNA（siRNA）药物，属于PCSK9抑制剂，主要用于降低胆固醇水平。该药物于2023年8月在中国获批上市，适用于治疗成年人原发性高胆固醇血症和混合型血脂异常，尤其针对他汀类药物治疗后低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL-C）未达目标值或不能耐受他汀类药物的患者。  \n\n英克司兰的作用机制是通过抑制PCSK9蛋白的表达，从而显著降低LDL-C水平，其降脂幅度与PCSK9单克隆抗体相近，但作用更为持久。相较于传统疗法，英克司兰的给药频率较低，为患者提供了更便利的治疗选择。  \n\n作为中国批准的首款用于降胆固醇的小干扰RNA药物，英克司兰代表了新一代降脂疗法的进展，为高胆固醇血症患者提供了新的治疗选择。\",4\r\n2059,托莱西单抗,\"托莱西单抗（Tolezumab）是一种PCSK9抑制剂，主要用于降低胆固醇水平。该药物通过抑制PCSK9蛋白活性，有效减少低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL-C）的浓度，从而帮助管理高胆固醇血症及相关心血管疾病风险。托莱西单抗的推荐给药方案为每2周皮下注射一次，每次剂量为150 mg，临床研究表明其LDL-C降幅与其他同类药物相似。  \n\n作为PCSK9抑制剂类药物，托莱西单抗在降低LDL-C方面表现出显著疗效，适用于对他汀类药物不耐受或需要进一步降低胆固醇水平的患者。其作用机制和临床效果与其他已上市的PCSK9抑制剂（如阿利西尤单抗和依洛尤单抗）相近，但具体疗效和安全性可能因个体差异而有所不同。  \n\n综上，托莱西单抗是一种有效的降胆固醇药物，通过定期皮下注射给药，为高胆固醇患者提供了一种重要的治疗选择。\",4\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n946,PCSK9,依折麦布,PCSK9 inhibitors and ezetimibe are alternative treatments for patients who cannot tolerate statins,13\r\n2504,MK?0616,PCSK9,MK?0616 is a PCSK9 inhibitor that works by blocking PCSK9's interaction with LDL-R,10\r\n2507,CRISPR?CAS,PCSK9,\"CRISPR-Cas gene editing can permanently inhibit PCSK9, offering a potential long-term solution for lipid management\",10\r\n1372,依洛尤单抗,阿利西尤单抗,Both are PCSK9 inhibitors,8\r\n1374,依洛尤单抗,英克司兰,Both are PCSK9 inhibitors,8\r\n1375,阿利西尤单抗,托莱西单抗,Both are PCSK9 inhibitors,8\r\n1377,托莱西单抗,英克司兰,Both are PCSK9 inhibitors,8\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
