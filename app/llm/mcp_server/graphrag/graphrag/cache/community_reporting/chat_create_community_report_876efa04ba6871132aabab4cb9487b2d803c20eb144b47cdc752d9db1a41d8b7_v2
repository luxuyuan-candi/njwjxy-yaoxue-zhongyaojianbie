It contains active compounds such as emodin, chrysophanol, and rhein, which contribute to its therapeutic effects.  \n\nPrimarily, 首乌 is known for its lipid-lowering properties, aiding in the reduction of cholesterol absorption and promoting its excretion through enhanced intestinal motility. This mechanism helps combat atherosclerosis by preventing the buildup of cholesterol in blood vessels. Additionally, its pharmacological effects align with its traditional use in supporting cardiovascular health.  \n\nThe herb's dual nomenclature—**首乌** in Chinese and **Polygonum multiflorum** in Latin—reflects its widespread recognition in both Eastern and Western medicinal contexts. Its applications are well-documented, emphasizing its role in improving lipid metabolism and mitigating arterial plaque formation.  \n\nIn summary, 首乌 is a versatile herbal remedy with scientifically supported benefits for lowering lipids and preventing atherosclerosis, rooted in both traditional practice and modern pharmacological understanding.\",5\r\n3941,大黄,\"大黄（Rhubarb）是蓼科植物大黄的根，具有多种药用功效。在传统中医中，大黄被广泛应用于温脾汤等方剂中，主要发挥其泻下通便的作用，适用于实证及大便干结者。此外，大黄还具有降脂功效，对调节血脂有一定效果。  \n\n尽管大黄被归类为破血药，可能因其泻下作用而被认为对体质虚弱者不利，但若运用得当，它可以通过“以泻为补”的方式改善因瘀血导致的病症，尤其对老年人常见的瘀滞问题有一定调理作用。因此，大黄在中医临床中既可用于实证通便，也可在特定情况下辅助改善瘀血相关疾病，体现其双向调节的特点。  \n\n综上，大黄是一种兼具泻下、降脂及活血化瘀作用的中药，其应用需根据个体体质和病症特点合理配伍，以发挥最佳疗效。\",4\r\n3961,复方平脂宁,\"A compound traditional Chinese medicine formulation used to treat hyperlipidemia\"\"\",2\r\n3016,泽泻,泽泻（Alisma plantago-aquatica）是一种传统中药材，广泛应用于中医药领域。它具有降血脂和抗动脉粥样硬化的功效，常用于治疗高脂血症等病症。泽泻常被制成泽泻粥或与其他中药成分（如红曲）配伍使用，形成复合制剂，以增强其疗效。作为中药成分之一，泽泻在多种复方制剂中发挥重要作用，体现了其在传统医学中的多样用途和重要地位。,4\r\n1546,肉桂,\"**肉桂** (Cinnamon) is a traditional Chinese medicine ingredient primarily used for warming the middle (spleen and stomach) and relieving pain.
