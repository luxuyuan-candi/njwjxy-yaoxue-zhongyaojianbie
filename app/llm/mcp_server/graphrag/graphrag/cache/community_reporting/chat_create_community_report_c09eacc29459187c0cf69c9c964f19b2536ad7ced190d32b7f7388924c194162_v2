It contains natural lovastatin and its analogs, along with other bioactive compounds, which contribute to its efficacy in managing hypercholesterolemia, particularly mild to moderate cases. As a statin-based drug, it reduces blood lipid levels and has been shown to lower the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile.  \n\nIn addition to its cholesterol-lowering effects, 血脂康 may assist in reducing blood sugar levels in diabetic patients, though its primary indication remains lipid regulation. It is classified as a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) preparation but shares pharmacological similarities with conventional statins due to its lovastatin content.  \n\nProduced domestically in China, 血脂康 is widely prescribed to modulate lipid metabolism and is recognized for its dual role as both a natural remedy and a clinically validated treatment for dyslipidemia.
