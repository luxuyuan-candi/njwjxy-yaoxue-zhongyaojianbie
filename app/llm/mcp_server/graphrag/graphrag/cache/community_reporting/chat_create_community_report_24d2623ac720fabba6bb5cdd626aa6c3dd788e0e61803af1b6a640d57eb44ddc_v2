It functions primarily to remove excess cholesterol from blood vessels and tissues, helping to prevent arterial hardening and atherosclerosis, earning it the nickname \"\"anti-atherosclerotic lipoprotein.\"\" HDL works by transporting other forms of cholesterol, such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL), away from the bloodstream and arterial walls, reducing the risk of plaque buildup and improving heart health.  \n\nIn addition to its role in cholesterol clearance, HDL is associated with broader health benefits. Studies indicate that reduced HDL levels may be linked to adverse outcomes in stroke patients and hypertension, particularly in animal models. Elevated HDL levels, on the other hand, are correlated with improved cardiovascular outcomes and can be achieved through lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, weight loss, smoking cessation, and dietary adjustments.  \n\nWhile HDL is universally recognized as beneficial, its mechanisms extend beyond cholesterol transport, influencing inflammation and endothelial function. Its multifaceted role underscores its importance in maintaining cardiovascular health and mitigating disease risks.\",7\r\n2156,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,\"**Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)** is a cardiovascular condition characterized by the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, primarily due to atherosclerosis—the buildup of plaque composed of cholesterol, fatty substances, and other cellular debris. This arterial narrowing restricts blood flow to the heart, potentially leading to serious complications such as heart attacks, myocardial ischemia, or sudden death.  \n\nCHD is closely linked to **high lipid levels**, particularly elevated **low-density lipoprotein (LDL)** and **very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)**, as well as reduced **high-density lipoprotein (HDL)**, which exacerbates atherosclerosis. Other contributing factors include **high cholesterol**, **triglycerides**, **hypertension**, **diabetes**, **obesity**, **smoking**, and **unhealthy dietary habits**—such as excessive intake of saturated and trans fats. Lifestyle modifications, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and smoking cessation, can mitigate risks.  \n\nThe disease's progression is influenced by **age**, **gender**, and **family history**, with varying incidence rates between men and women. Additionally, conditions like **hyperlipidemia** and **hypertension** further elevate CHD risk. Early detection through lipid profile assessments and management of underlying risk factors are critical in preventing severe outcomes.  \n\nIn summary, CHD arises from a combination of **atherosclerosis**, **dyslipidemia**, and **lifestyle factors**, underscoring the importance of proactive cardiovascular health management.\",29\r\n2203,VERY LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"Very low-density lipoprotein is another atherogenic lipoprotein whose elevated levels are linked to the occurrence of coronary heart disease, primarily containing triglycerides>\",2\r\n2204,INTERMEDIATE DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,Intermediate-density lipoprotein may have a mild atherogenic effect>,2\r\n2205,CHYLOMICRON,\"Chylomicron, mainly containing triglycerides, has no significant atherogenic effect>\",2\r\n2341,HIGH BLOOD LIPID DISEASE,\"High blood lipid disease is a condition characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides, and reduced high-density lipoprotein, leading to coronary heart disease and hypertension\",2\r\n2663,SATURATED FATTY ACIDS,\"Saturated fatty acids are found in animal meats, dairy products, and animal fats, and are known to raise blood lipids and increase the risk of heart disease\"\"\",1\r\n2739,PRIMARY PREVENTION,\"Primary prevention involves lowering cholesterol in individuals with risk factors for coronary heart disease but no existing condition.\"\"\",1\r\n2740,SECONDARY PREVENTION,\"Secondary prevention involves lowering cholesterol in individuals already diagnosed with coronary heart disease to prevent further complications.\"\"\",1\r\n2741,ANGINA,\"Chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscles, often a symptom of coronary artery disease\",1\r\n2168,LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"**Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)** is a type of lipoprotein responsible for transporting cholesterol into surrounding tissues, including blood vessels. It accounts for approximately 75% of total cholesterol in the body. LDL plays a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of arterial plaques. When LDL levels are elevated, it deposits cholesterol in the walls of arteries, contributing to plaque formation and narrowing of the blood vessels. This process increases the risk of coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular complications. Due to its role in cholesterol transport and plaque accumulation, LDL is often referred to as \"\"bad cholesterol.\"\" Elevated LDL levels are strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, making it a critical biomarker in cardiovascular health assessments.\",5\r\n2169,HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"**High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)** is a type of cholesterol commonly referred to as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol due to its beneficial effects on heart health. HDL accounts for approximately 25% of total cholesterol in the body and plays a critical role in transporting excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver for processing and excretion, a process known as reverse cholesterol transport. This function helps prevent the buildup of cholesterol in arteries, thereby reducing the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.  \n\nHDL is measured in millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), with higher levels generally associated with better cardiovascular protection. Low HDL levels, conversely, correlate with an increased incidence of coronary heart disease. Beyond cholesterol transport, HDL activates key enzymes involved in lipoprotein metabolism and contributes to the clearance of cholesterol from tissues, further supporting its protective role in the cardiovascular system.  \n\nOverall, HDL is recognized for its ability to safeguard against heart disease by promoting efficient cholesterol removal and maintaining arterial health. Its multifaceted functions underscore its importance in cardiovascular risk assessment and preventive health strategies.\",5\r\n1575,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,\"**High Lipidemia** is a medical condition characterized by elevated levels of lipids—including cholesterol and triglycerides—in the blood. It is often caused by dietary and lifestyle factors such as excessive alcohol consumption, high-fat diets, lack of exercise, and genetic predisposition. Poor management of these factors can lead to serious health complications, including pancreatitis, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and metabolic disorders. High lipidemia is also a significant global health concern, acting as a \"\"silent killer\"\" and a major contributor to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.  \n\nThe condition is typically managed through dietary adjustments, regular exercise, and medication. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), high lipidemia is classified under categories such as \"\"blood stasis,\"\" \"\"phlegm-dampness,\"\" and \"\"lipid turbidity.\"\" TCM views it as a deficiency-excess syndrome, where phlegm and stasis are the manifestations, while deficiency serves as the root cause.  \n\nGiven its association with multiple systemic health risks, early detection and intervention are crucial to prevent long-term complications. Lifestyle modifications, alongside medical treatment, play a key role in controlling lipid levels and reducing the risk of associated diseases.\",25\r\n2352,KIDNEY DISEASE,\"**Kidney Disease** is a medical condition that can both result from and contribute to other health complications. It is often linked to **hypertension (high blood pressure)**, as prolonged elevated blood pressure can damage the kidneys over time, impairing their function. Conversely, kidney disease can also lead to metabolic disturbances, such as **high lipidemia (elevated levels of lipids in the blood)**, due to the kidneys' role in filtering and regulating bodily fluids and waste. Thus, kidney disease exists in a bidirectional relationship with certain systemic conditions, where it may arise as a consequence of hypertension while also exacerbating or triggering lipid metabolism disorders. Proper management of kidney disease involves addressing both its underlying causes and its potential secondary effects on overall health.\",2\r\n1576,TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE,\"Traditional Chinese Medicine is a medical system that diagnoses and treats high lipidemia by addressing imbalances in the liver, spleen, and kidney functions, and the accumulation of pathological products like stasis, dampness, and phlegm.\"\"\",1\r\n2218,XANTHOMA,\"Yellowish deposits of fat under the skin, often indicative of high lipid levels, with various types like eyelid xanthoma, tendon xanthoma, and palmar xanthoma>\",1\r\n2294,CIRRHOSIS,\"Cirrhosis is a late-stage liver disease that can be caused by high lipidemia leading to fatty liver and subsequent liver damage.\"\"\",1\r\n2295,PANCREATITIS,\"Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, which can be triggered by high lipidemia.\"\"\",1\r\n2296,GALLSTONES,\"Gallstones are hardened deposits in the gallbladder, often associated with high lipidemia.\"\"\",1\r\n2347,THYROID FUNCTION,\"Thyroid function refers to the activity of the thyroid gland, which can influence lipid metabolism and contribute to high lipidemia when impaired>\",1\r\n2348,FAMILIAL HYPERLIPIDEMIA,Familial hyperlipidemia is a genetic disorder that causes abnormally high levels of lipids in the blood due to inherited mutations>,1\r\n2351,THYROID FUNCTION DECLINE,\"Thyroid function decline is a condition that can cause high lipidemia.\"\"\",1\r\n2368,ALCOHOLISM,Alcoholism is a factor associated with late-stage high lipidemia,1\r\n2439,SOY PROTEIN,\"Soy protein is recommended as part of the dietary management for high lipidemia due to its beneficial effects on lipid levels.\"\"\",1\r\n2157,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,\"**Atherosclerosis** is a chronic cardiovascular disease characterized by the progressive buildup of fatty plaques, primarily composed of cholesterol, lipids, and other substances, on the inner walls of arteries. This accumulation leads to the narrowing and hardening of the arteries, a process known as arteriosclerosis, which restricts blood flow and increases the risk of serious complications such as coronary heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes.  \n\nThe condition is strongly associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as \"\"bad\"\" cholesterol, as well as high lipidemia (excessive fats in the blood). These factors contribute to plaque formation, which can eventually rupture, triggering blood clots that further obstruct circulation. Conversely, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, known as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol, plays a protective role by helping to remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream, thereby slowing the progression of atherosclerosis.  \n\nAtherosclerosis develops gradually and is influenced by multiple risk factors, including poor diet, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and genetic predisposition. Over time, the narrowing of arteries reduces oxygen and nutrient supply to vital organs, potentially leading to life-threatening cardiovascular events.  \n\nIn summary, atherosclerosis is a systemic disease driven by lipid imbalances, particularly high LDL cholesterol, and is marked by arterial plaque buildup, arterial stiffening, and impaired blood flow. Management focuses on lifestyle modifications, cholesterol-lowering medications, and controlling underlying conditions to mitigate its progression and associated risks.\",12\r\n2293,MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,\"**Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack)**  \n\nMyocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, is a severe medical condition that occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked for an extended period, leading to damage or death of the heart muscle. This blockage is often caused by atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits (plaques) in the coronary arteries, which restricts blood supply.  \n\nThe condition is strongly associated with coronary heart disease and is frequently linked to elevated levels of lipids in the blood, including very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a). These lipid abnormalities contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of arterial blockages. Additionally, myocardial infarction is recognized as a severe outcome of coronary heart disease, underscoring the importance of managing cardiovascular risk factors such as high cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes.  \n\nWhile the descriptions vary slightly in emphasis—some highlighting lipid imbalances, others focusing on coronary artery disease—they collectively reinforce that myocardial infarction results from disrupted blood flow to the heart, often due to underlying vascular disease. The condition remains a critical health concern requiring prompt medical intervention to prevent irreversible damage.\",7\r\n2297,LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,Low-density lipoprotein is referred to as 'bad' cholesterol associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases,5\r\n2329,LIPOPROTEIN(A),\"Lipoprotein(a) is an independent lipoprotein that can cause arteriosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and myocardial infarction when levels are elevated>\",3\r\n2312,HIGH LIPID LEVELS,\"**HIGH LIPID LEVELS (Hyperlipidemia)**  \n\nHigh lipid levels, also referred to as hyperlipidemia, are characterized by elevated concentrations of lipids—including cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)—in the blood. This condition is a significant risk factor for coronary heart disease and other serious cardiovascular diseases if left untreated. While high lipid levels often present no symptoms in their early stages, prolonged elevation can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, increasing the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes.  \n\nMedical guidelines provide specific thresholds for cholesterol and LDL levels to assess an individual's risk. For instance, high total cholesterol (typically above 200 mg/dL) and elevated LDL (often termed \"\"bad cholesterol\"\") are key indicators used to determine the need for lifestyle modifications or medical interventions. Management typically involves dietary changes, increased physical activity, and, in some cases, lipid-lowering medications such as statins.  \n\nThe condition underscores the importance of regular screening, as early detection and intervention can mitigate long-term health risks. Despite its asymptomatic nature in initial phases, hyperlipidemia demands proactive management to prevent severe cardiovascular complications.\",3\r\n2206,APOLIPOPROTEIN,\"Apolipoprotein is a special protein that binds with lipids to form lipoproteins, facilitating their transport in the bloodstream>\",5\r\n2339,ASPIRIN,\"Aspirin is a medication used in cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment, often alongside statins\",1\r\n2331,TAIWAN MAKAY,\"Taiwan Makay is an institution with experience in weight control, noting that weight loss can lead to reduced blood cholesterol levels>\",1\r\n2342,STATIN DRUGS,\"Statin drugs are a class of medications used to lower cholesterol and treat high blood lipid disease, including Lovastatin, Simvastatin, Pravastatin, etc.\",2\r\n2343,BRITISH HYPERTENSION SOCIETY,The British Hypertension Society recommends statin drugs as primary and secondary prevention for cardiovascular diseases,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1751,HIGH BLOOD LIPIDS,HYPERTENSION,High blood lipids can lead to hypertension,42\r\n1646,HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,\"**Summary of HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) and CORONARY HEART DISEASE (CHD):**  \n\nHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL), often referred to as \"\"good cholesterol,\"\" plays a protective role against coronary heart disease (CHD) through multiple mechanisms. Primarily, HDL helps reduce the risk of CHD by removing excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and transporting it to the liver for excretion, thereby preventing the buildup of arterial plaque. This process not only mitigates atherosclerosis—a key contributor to CHD—but also supports overall cardiovascular health.  \n\nAdditionally, research indicates that low levels of HDL are associated with an increased risk of developing CHD, underscoring its importance as a biomarker for cardiovascular risk. The inverse relationship between HDL levels and CHD risk highlights HDL's critical function in maintaining healthy cholesterol balance and protecting against arterial damage.  \n\nIn summary, HDL serves as a vital defense against coronary heart disease by promoting cholesterol clearance, reducing plaque formation, and lowering overall cardiovascular risk. Maintaining adequate HDL levels is therefore essential for heart health.\",36\r\n1595,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,UNITED STATES,The United States recommends lipid checks for children at risk of coronary heart disease,32\r\n1529,VERY LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,Increased levels of very low-density lipoprotein are associated with the occurrence of coronary heart disease,31\r\n1533,INTERMEDIATE DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,Intermediate-density lipoprotein may contribute mildly to the development of coronary heart disease,31\r\n1535,CHYLOMICRON,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,Chylomicron has no significant effect on the development of coronary heart disease,31\r\n1775,HIGH BLOOD LIPID DISEASE,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,High blood lipid disease is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease,31\r\n2082,SATURATED FATTY ACIDS,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,\"Saturated fatty acids contribute to elevated blood lipids, increasing the risk of coronary heart disease\",30\r\n2104,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,PRIMARY PREVENTION,Primary prevention aims to reduce the risk of developing coronary heart disease.,30\r\n2105,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,SECONDARY PREVENTION,Secondary prevention aims to manage and reduce complications in individuals already diagnosed with coronary heart disease.,30\r\n2108,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,ANGINA,Angina is a symptom of coronary heart disease,30\r\n1487,LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CHOLESTEROL,LDL carries cholesterol into surrounding tissues,28\r\n1488,HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CHOLESTEROL,HDL transports cholesterol from tissues back to the liver,28\r\n1797,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,KIDNEY DISEASE,Kidney disease can cause high lipidemia,27\r\n1115,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE,\"Traditional Chinese Medicine provides diagnostic and treatment approaches for high lipidemia, categorizing it under specific syndromes and suggesting dietary and lifestyle adjustments.\",26\r\n1550,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,XANTHOMA,\"High lipidemia can cause xanthomas, which are symptomatic of lipid metabolism disorders\",26\r\n1678,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,CIRRHOSIS,High lipidemia can progress to cirrhosis via fatty liver disease.,26\r\n1679,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,PANCREATITIS,High lipidemia can trigger pancreatitis.,26\r\n1680,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,GALLSTONES,High lipidemia is associated with the formation of gallstones.,26\r\n1789,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,THYROID FUNCTION,Impaired thyroid function can lead to high lipidemia by disrupting lipid metabolism,26\r\n1790,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,FAMILIAL HYPERLIPIDEMIA,Familial hyperlipidemia is a genetic cause of high lipidemia,26\r\n1796,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,THYROID FUNCTION DECLINE,Thyroid function decline can cause high lipidemia,26\r\n1813,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,ALCOHOLISM,Alcoholism is a contributing factor to late-stage high lipidemia,26\r\n1868,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,SOY PROTEIN,Soy protein is recommended in the diet for managing high lipidemia,26\r\n1766,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,Atherosclerosis can lead to myocardial infarction by blocking coronary arteries,19\r\n1696,LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,\"**Summary of LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN and ATHEROSCLEROSIS:**  \n\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL) plays a significant role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Often referred to as \"\"bad cholesterol,\"\" LDL contributes to the condition by depositing cholesterol on the walls of arteries. This accumulation leads to the formation of arterial plaques, which narrow and stiffen the blood vessels, impairing blood flow. Over time, these plaques can grow, increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications such as heart attacks and strokes.  \n\nThe descriptions consistently highlight LDL's involvement in atherosclerosis through cholesterol deposition in arterial walls, emphasizing its role in plaque formation. While the phrasing varies slightly across sources, the core mechanism remains the same: LDL transports cholesterol to arterial tissues, where it becomes trapped, triggering inflammatory responses and plaque buildup. This process underscores the importance of managing LDL levels to mitigate the risk of atherosclerosis and its associated health consequences.  \n\nIn summary, LDL is a key contributor to atherosclerosis by facilitating cholesterol deposition in arterial walls, leading to plaque formation and vascular dysfunction. Addressing elevated LDL levels through lifestyle changes or medical interventions is critical in preventing or slowing the progression of this disease.\",17\r\n1748,ARTERIOSCLEROSIS,LIPOPROTEIN(A),Elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) can cause arteriosclerosis,14\r\n1774,HIGH LIPID LEVELS,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,High lipid levels are a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases,12\r\n1528,LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,APOLIPOPROTEIN,Apolipoprotein binds with lipids to form low-density lipoprotein,10\r\n1750,MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,LIPOPROTEIN(A),Elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) can cause myocardial infarction,10\r\n1764,ASPIRIN,MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,Aspirin is used to prevent myocardial infarction in patients with cardiovascular disease,8\r\n1754,HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,TAIWAN MAKAY,Taiwan Makay's weight control programs have observed a correlation between weight loss and improved HDL levels,6\r\n1777,STATIN DRUGS,BRITISH HYPERTENSION SOCIETY,The British Hypertension Society recommends statin drugs for cardiovascular disease prevention,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
