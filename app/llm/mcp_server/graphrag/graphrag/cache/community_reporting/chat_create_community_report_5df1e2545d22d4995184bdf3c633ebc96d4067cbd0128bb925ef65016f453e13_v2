It functions by removing excess cholesterol, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL), from blood vessels and tissues, thereby helping to prevent arterial hardening and atherosclerosis. HDL is often termed the \"\"anti-atherosclerotic lipoprotein\"\" for its role in clearing cholesterol from arterial walls, reducing the risk of heart disease.  \n\nSeveral factors influence HDL levels. Regular exercise and physical activity are known to elevate HDL, while smoking has a negative impact, lowering levels by approximately 0.13â0.23 mmol/L compared to non-smokers. Dietary choices, such as consuming garlic, and lifestyle changes, including weight loss and smoking cessation, can also increase HDL concentrations.  \n\nBeyond cardiovascular benefits, HDL plays a role in broader health contexts, including stroke and hypertension in animals, where reduced levels are associated with adverse outcomes. Overall, HDL is a crucial component of lipid metabolism, promoting heart health by facilitating cholesterol removal from the bloodstream and counteracting the harmful effects of LDL. Maintaining optimal HDL levels through healthy lifestyle choices is widely recommended for long-term cardiovascular protection.\",19\r\n3451,LONG-DISTANCE RUNNERS,\"Athletes studied showing improved HDL and reduced LDL levels compared to sedentary individuals\"\"\",1\r\n4107,DARK CHOCOLATE,Food that may help improve cholesterol profile,1\r\n3922,TRAZODONE,ç¹æååª is an Î±-receptor blocker used to treat high blood pressure and can increase high-density lipoprotein levels,4\r\n3479,OLIVE OIL,\"**Olive Oil** is a healthy oil known for its beneficial properties, particularly in supporting cholesterol levels.
