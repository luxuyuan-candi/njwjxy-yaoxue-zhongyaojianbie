It plays a significant role in drug interactions by influencing the rates at which certain medications are metabolized, thereby affecting their efficacy and safety. CYP2D6 is known to be inhibited by specific compounds, such as paroxetine (帕罗西汀), which can alter its enzymatic activity and impact drug processing.  \n\nAs a key enzyme in drug metabolism, CYP2D6 contributes to individual variability in drug response, making it an important consideration in pharmacogenomics. Its function can be modulated by inhibitors, leading to potential changes in the pharmacokinetics of co-administered drugs. The enzyme's activity is essential for the proper breakdown and elimination of many therapeutic agents, underscoring its clinical relevance in personalized medicine.  \n\nIn summary, CYP2D6 is a vital metabolic enzyme with a broad role in drug metabolism, influenced by inhibitors like paroxetine, and contributes significantly to drug interaction dynamics.
