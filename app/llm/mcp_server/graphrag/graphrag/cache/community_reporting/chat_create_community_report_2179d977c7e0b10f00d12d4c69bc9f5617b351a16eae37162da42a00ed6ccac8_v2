It serves multiple purposes, including identifying conditions such as white coat hypertension, masked hypertension, and resistant hypertension, as well as evaluating long-term blood pressure variability, assessing the efficacy of antihypertensive treatments, and predicting cardiovascular risk and prognosis. The diagnostic threshold for hypertension via HBPM is an average systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥135 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥85 mmHg.  \n\nHBPM can be performed by patients themselves or with the assistance of family members, making it a flexible and accessible tool for self-measured or home-based blood pressure assessment. It plays a significant role in enhancing patient health awareness, improving treatment adherence, and facilitating long-term blood pressure management. Additionally, HBPM is recognized as both a self-management tool for patients and an auxiliary diagnostic method for hypertension.  \n\nWith advancements in telemetry technology, internet-based remote HBPM and management systems are emerging as potential future models for blood pressure control. However, further research is needed to validate their effectiveness and health economic benefits. Despite its advantages, improper use of self-monitoring devices—including wearables—may lead to excessive focus on blood pressure, frequent measurements, and fluctuations, which could negatively impact patient well-being.  \n\nIn summary, HBPM is a valuable tool for general hypertension monitoring, offering diagnostic, prognostic, and self-management benefits while requiring proper implementation to maximize its advantages.\",13\r\n1125,家庭血压监测,Chinese term for HBPM (Home Blood Pressure Monitoring),1\r\n1128,MASKED HYPERTENSION,\"A condition where a patient's blood pressure is normal in clinical settings but elevated elsewhere, detectable via HBPM\",1\r\n1130,BLOOD PRESSURE REMOTE MONITORING,Emerging technology for internet-based home blood pressure tracking mentioned in HBPM context,1\r\n1131,WEARABLE BLOOD PRESSURE DEVICES,Technology referenced in HBPM discussion that may cause excessive monitoring if misused,1\r\n1132,WHITE COAT HYPERTENSION,,3\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n922,HBPM,家庭血压监测,家庭血压监测 is the Chinese term for HBPM,14\r\n928,HBPM,MASKED HYPERTENSION,HBPM is used to diagnose masked hypertension by comparing clinical vs. home measurements,14\r\n930,HBPM,BLOOD PRESSURE REMOTE MONITORING,Remote monitoring represents an advanced evolution of traditional HBPM methods,14\r\n931,HBPM,WEARABLE BLOOD PRESSURE DEVICES,Wearables represent a technological extension of HBPM capabilities,14\r\n1004,WHITE COAT HYPERTENSION,RESISTANT HYPERTENSION,White coat hypertension must be ruled out when diagnosing resistant hypertension,9\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
