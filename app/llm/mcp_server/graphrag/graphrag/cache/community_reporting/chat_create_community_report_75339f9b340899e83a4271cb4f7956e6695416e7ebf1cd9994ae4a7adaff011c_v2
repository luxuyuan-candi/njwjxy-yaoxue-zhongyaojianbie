It plays a crucial role in the breakdown and metabolism of various drugs, including **eplerenone**, **finerenone**, **verapamil**, and **diltiazem**. Additionally, CYP3A4 can interfere with the metabolism of **chemotherapy drugs**, potentially increasing the risk of toxicity, especially when its activity is inhibited by certain medications. This enzyme's inhibition may lead to elevated levels of chemotherapy agents in the body, heightening adverse effects. Thus, CYP3A4 is a key factor in drug interactions and pharmacokinetics, influencing both therapeutic efficacy and safety.\",6\n1570,VEGFI,\"**VEGFI (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Inhibitor)** is an anti-tumor drug used in the treatment of cancer. It functions by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor, thereby impeding tumor growth. However, a notable side effect of VEGFI is its potential to induce hypertension. This occurs due to the drug's ability to reduce nitric oxide generation, which plays a role in blood vessel dilation and blood pressure regulation. As a result, VEGFI is also involved in managing hypertension during tumor treatment, highlighting its dual role in both anti-tumor therapy and associated cardiovascular effects.  \n\nThe summary integrates both descriptions, resolving any apparent contradictions by clarifying that VEGFI's hypertension-inducing effect is linked to its mechanism of reducing nitric oxide, which is also why it requires careful blood pressure management in patients undergoing tumor treatment.\",4\n1576,CHEMOTHERAPY,\"\nCancer treatment that may interact with blood pressure medications>\",3\n1413,NON-DIHYDROPYRIDINE CCB,\"The **non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs)** are a class of medications primarily used to treat high blood pressure and heart rhythm disorders.
