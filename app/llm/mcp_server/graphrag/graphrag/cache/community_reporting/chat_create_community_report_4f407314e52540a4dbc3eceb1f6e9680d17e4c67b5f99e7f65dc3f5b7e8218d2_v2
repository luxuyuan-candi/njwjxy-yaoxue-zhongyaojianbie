The nation has implemented proactive health measures, including the **National Cholesterol Education Program**, which treats diabetes in high-cholesterol patients as equivalent to coronary disease, emphasizing the importance of early intervention.  \n\nFrom **1974 to 1993**, the U.S. experienced a significant decline in CHD and stroke mortality rates, reflecting advancements in medical research, public health initiatives, and preventive care. To further mitigate risks, the country recommends **lipid checks for children aged 2 and above** if they exhibit high-risk factors for CHD, underscoring a focus on early detection and management.  \n\nAdditionally, the U.S. invests heavily in cardiovascular health, spending **over $2 billion annually** on lipid-lowering treatments. This substantial financial commitment highlights the prioritization of combating cholesterol-related conditions and improving long-term public health outcomes. Collectively, these efforts demonstrate the nation's comprehensive approach to reducing coronary heart disease through prevention, education, and medical intervention.\",6\r\n3568,JOGGING,\"**JOGGING** is a versatile form of aerobic exercise with broad health benefits across different age groups and health conditions. It is particularly recommended for obese individuals as an effective way to aid weight loss and improve overall health. Additionally, jogging is highlighted as a beneficial activity for managing blood pressure and cholesterol levels, contributing to cardiovascular health.  \n\nFor elderly individuals, jogging is noted as a suitable aerobic exercise, provided it is performed at a moderate intensity and tailored to their fitness levels. While it offers cardiovascular and metabolic advantages, older adults should ensure proper warm-up, hydration, and gradual progression to avoid injury.  \n\nIn summary, jogging serves as an accessible and adaptable exercise for weight management, cardiovascular health, and general fitness, making it a valuable activity for diverse populations, including obese individuals, those with hypertension or high cholesterol, and older adults seeking to maintain mobility and endurance.\",2\r\n3401,WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION,\"The **World Health Organization (WHO)** is a specialized agency of the United Nations dedicated to international public health. As a global health authority, WHO plays a pivotal role in providing evidence-based guidelines, health statistics, and recommendations to address major health challenges worldwide.  \n\nWHO has emphasized the importance of physical activity, stating in 1995 that walking is the best form of exercise for humans due to its alignment with our physiological and anatomical structure. Additionally, the organization offers detailed health check-up guidelines, including recommendations for lipid testing: every two years for individuals with no underlying risk factors and annually for those over 40, obese individuals, or people with specific risk factors or existing cardiovascular conditions.  \n\nWHO also monitors and reports on global health trends, particularly concerning cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). The organization provides comprehensive statistics on CVD-related mortality rates and analyzes emerging trends in different types of cardiovascular conditions. Through its research and public health initiatives, WHO aims to reduce the global burden of non-communicable diseases, including CVDs, by promoting preventive measures and evidence-based interventions.  \n\nIn summary, the World Health Organization serves as a leading global health authority, offering guidance on exercise, preventive health measures, and disease surveillance while addressing critical public health issues such as cardiovascular diseases. Its recommendations and reports are instrumental in shaping health policies and individual health practices worldwide.\",8\r\n3569,WALKING,\"**WALKING** is widely recognized as a highly beneficial form of physical activity, endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the best exercises for overall health. It is particularly recommended for obese individuals as a sustainable and accessible way to aid in weight loss and improve general well-being. Additionally, walking is emphasized as an effective method for managing chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol levels, and diabetes.  \n\nRegular walking has been proven to enhance cardiovascular health by reducing blood lipids, preventing atherosclerosis, and improving circulation. The key principles for maximizing its benefits include consistency (regular practice), progression (gradually increasing intensity or duration), and moderation (avoiding overexertion). WHO highlights its role in not only preventing but also managing conditions like hyperlipidemia and metabolic disorders.  \n\nBeyond its physical advantages, walking serves as a versatile exercise suitable for people of varying fitness levels, making it an inclusive option for long-term health maintenance. Whether for general fitness, weight management, or specific health conditions, walking is a universally accessible and scientifically supported activity. Its low-impact nature ensures sustainability, while its adaptability allows individuals to tailor it to their personal health goals.  \n\nIn summary, walking is a cornerstone of preventive and therapeutic exercise, offering broad-ranging benefits from weight loss and cardiovascular improvement to chronic disease management, all while being simple, cost-effective, and adaptable to individual needs.\",5\r\n3402,JAPAN,\"Japan is a country known for its significant contributions to medical research and public health advancements.
