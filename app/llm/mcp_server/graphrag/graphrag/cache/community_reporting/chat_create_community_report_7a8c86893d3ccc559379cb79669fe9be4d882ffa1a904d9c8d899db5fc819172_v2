It is commonly used to treat conditions such as acute gout attacks, where it helps alleviate pain and swelling by suppressing inflammatory responses.  \n\nAs a potent corticosteroid, 曲安奈德 carries potential risks, including an increased susceptibility to infections, osteoporosis with prolonged use, and other systemic side effects associated with glucocorticoids. Medical professionals exercise caution when prescribing or administering this medication, ensuring that the benefits outweigh the risks for each patient.  \n\nThe descriptions provided align in characterizing 曲安奈德 as an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid used for joint and muscle-related conditions, with an emphasis on its therapeutic application in acute gout. The combined summary integrates its clinical use with necessary precautions regarding adverse effects.\",2\r\n347,骨质疏松,骨质疏松（Osteoporosis）是一种慢性疾病，主要表现为骨密度降低和骨组织微结构退化，从而增加骨折风险。该病症既可能是长期使用糖皮质激素（glucocorticoid therapy）的并发症之一，也被视为威胁中老年人健康的常见慢性病。研究表明，适量运动有助于增加骨密度，改善骨骼健康，进而提升老年人的生活质量。因此，在临床管理中，骨质疏松的防治需结合药物干预（如避免长期过量使用糖皮质激素）和生活方式调整（如规律运动），以降低骨折风险并促进整体健康。,2\r\n343,高血糖,\"**高血糖 (Hyperglycemia)**  \n\n高血糖 refers to elevated blood sugar levels, a condition commonly associated with diabetes and metabolic disorders. It is recognized as one of the \"\"three highs\"\" (alongside hypertension and hyperlipidemia) that contribute to significant health risks, including cardiovascular disease and organ damage. Additionally, 高血糖 can arise as a metabolic side effect of corticosteroid therapy, which may disrupt insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation.  \n\nWhile diabetes is a primary cause of 高血糖, the condition can also occur in non-diabetic individuals due to medications, stress, or other underlying health issues. Managing 高血糖 typically involves lifestyle modifications, medication, and monitoring to prevent complications. The dual association—both as a hallmark of diabetes and a drug-induced side effect—highlights its multifaceted nature in clinical and metabolic contexts.  \n\n(Word count: 120)\",1\r\n341,关节感染,\"A contraindication for corticosteroid injections, requiring exclusion before treatment.\"\"\",1\r\n325,复方倍他米松,复方倍他米松（Compound Betamethasone）是一种糖皮质激素类药物，主要用于关节腔内或肌肉注射以治疗炎症及相关疾病。它具有抗炎和免疫抑制作用，适用于大关节受累的急性痛风发作等病症。作为皮质类固醇，复方倍他米松能有效缓解关节或肌肉的炎症反应，但使用时需注意其潜在副作用，包括高血压和感染风险。该药物结合了两种成分（如倍他米松磷酸钠和倍他米松二丙酸酯），以提供快速起效和持久疗效。临床应用中，医生需根据患者情况权衡其疗效与不良反应，确保合理使用。,2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n294,糖皮质激素,泼尼松,泼尼松是糖皮质激素的一种具体药物，用于急性痛风发作的治疗。,11\r\n296,糖皮质激素,曲安奈德,曲安奈德是糖皮质激素的一种具体药物，可用于关节腔内或肌肉注射治疗痛风。,11\r\n307,糖皮质激素,骨质疏松,Prolonged glucocorticoid therapy increases osteoporosis risk.,11\r\n306,糖皮质激素,高血糖,Corticosteroid use is linked to elevated blood sugar levels.,10\r\n308,糖皮质激素,关节感染,Joint infection must be ruled out before corticosteroid injections.,10\r\n301,泼尼松,痛风急性发作,Low-dose prednisone is a third-line option for gout prevention when other drugs fail.,7\r\n297,复方倍他米松,曲安奈德,Both are injectable glucocorticoids used for joint/muscle inflammation but carry risks like infection.,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
