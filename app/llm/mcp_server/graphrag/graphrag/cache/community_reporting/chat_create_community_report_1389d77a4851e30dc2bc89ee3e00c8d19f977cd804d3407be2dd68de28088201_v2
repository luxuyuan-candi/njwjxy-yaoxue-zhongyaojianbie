The condition arises when a blood vessel ruptures, leading to the accumulation of blood in the brain, which can cause increased intracranial pressure, tissue damage, and life-threatening complications.  \n\nGlobally, there is no universally accepted consensus on the surgical treatment of ICH. However, in clinical practice, the primary objectives of surgical intervention are to promptly remove the hematoma, relieve brain compression, alleviate severe intracranial hypertension and herniation, and save the patient's life. Additionally, surgery aims to minimize secondary brain damage and disability caused by prolonged hematoma pressure.  \n\nWhile medical management remains critical in stabilizing patients, surgical approaches are often considered in cases where hematoma evacuation can prevent further neurological deterioration. The decision to operate depends on factors such as hemorrhage location, volume, and the patient's overall condition. Despite variations in treatment protocols, the overarching goal is to improve survival rates and functional outcomes for individuals affected by ICH.  \n\nIn summary, ICH is a medical emergency requiring immediate attention, with treatment strategies—including surgical options—focused on reducing mortality and long-term disability. Further research is needed to establish standardized surgical guidelines for optimal patient care.\",22\r\n1798,INTERACT-2,\"Follow-up study to INTERACT, further examining blood pressure management in acute ICH cases\"\"\",2\r\n1828,脑疝,\"外科治疗ICH的主要目标包括解除脑压迫、缓解严重颅内高压及脑疝\"\"\",2\r\n1799,CUSHING’S RESPONSE,\"A physiological response to increased intracranial pressure, causing abnormal blood pressure elevation\"\"\",1\r\n1800,MANNITOL,\"Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic used to reduce intracranial pressure in ICH patients\"\"\",1\r\n1802,PROPOFOL,\"Propofol is a sedative agent used for intracranial pressure management in ICH\"\"\",1\r\n1803,ETOMIDATE,\"Etomidate is an intravenous anesthetic used for sedation in neurocritical care\"\"\",1\r\n1804,MIDAZOLAM,\"Midazolam is a benzodiazepine sedative used in ICH patient management\"\"\",1\r\n1805,MORPHINE,\"Morphine is an opioid analgesic used for pain control in neurocritical cases\"\"\",1\r\n1806,ALFENTANIL,\"Alfentanil is a short-acting opioid used for analgesia in ICH patients\"\"\",1\r\n1820,EPILEPTIC SEIZURE,A possible complication of ICH that may require antiepileptic drug treatment.,1\r\n1829,继发性脑损伤,\"外科治疗ICH的目标包括尽可能降低由血肿压迫导致的继发性脑损伤\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1494,ICH,ATACH,ATACH study provides clinical guidelines for blood pressure management in ICH cases,24\r\n1496,ICH,INTERACT-2,INTERACT-2 study further refined blood pressure management approaches for ICH,24\r\n1531,ICH,脑疝,外科治疗ICH的主要目标包括缓解严重颅内高压及脑疝,24\r\n1497,ICH,CUSHING’S RESPONSE,Cushing's response may occur as a complication of severe ICH,23\r\n1501,ICH,MANNITOL,Mannitol is a primary osmotic agent for reducing intracranial pressure in ICH,23\r\n1503,ICH,PROPOFOL,Propofol is used for sedation to prevent ICP elevation in ICH patients,23\r\n1504,ICH,ETOMIDATE,Etomidate provides hemodynamically stable sedation for ICH procedures,23\r\n1505,ICH,MIDAZOLAM,Midazolam is used for sedation in ventilated ICH patients,23\r\n1506,ICH,MORPHINE,Morphine provides analgesia while minimizing ICP elevation in ICH,23\r\n1507,ICH,ALFENTANIL,Alfentanil offers short-duration analgesia for ICH procedures,23\r\n1527,EPILEPTIC SEIZURE,ICH,ICH patients may develop epileptic seizures requiring antiepileptic treatment,23\r\n1532,ICH,继发性脑损伤,外科治疗ICH的目标包括尽可能降低由血肿压迫导致的继发性脑损伤,23\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
