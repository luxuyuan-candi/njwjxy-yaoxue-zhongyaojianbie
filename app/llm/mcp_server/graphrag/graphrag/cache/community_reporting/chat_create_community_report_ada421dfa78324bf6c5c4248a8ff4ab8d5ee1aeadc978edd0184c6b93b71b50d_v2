It is produced primarily by the liver and serves as a carrier for triglycerides, cholesterol, and other lipids through the bloodstream to peripheral tissues. While VLDL is essential for transporting energy in the form of triglycerides, elevated levels can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of plaques in arterial walls, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, VLDL has a dual function: it is both a critical component of normal lipid metabolism and a potential contributor to vascular pathology when present in excessive amounts.  \n\nThe two provided descriptions highlight these contrasting aspects—VLDL's physiological role in lipid transport and its pathological association with atherosclerosis—without direct contradiction.
