It functions as a non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, effectively reducing inflammation and alleviating pain. While some descriptions indicate it is available over-the-counter, its regulatory status may vary by region.  \n\nDiclofenac is commonly prescribed for acute pain management, with a typical dosage of 50 mg administered three times daily due to its relatively short half-life of approximately two hours. This pharmacokinetic profile makes it suitable for short-term use in conditions requiring rapid pain relief.  \n\nAs an NSAID, diclofenac shares therapeutic properties with other drugs in its class, such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects. However, its accessibility (prescription vs. over-the-counter) and specific dosing regimens should be confirmed based on local medical guidelines. Overall, diclofenac is a widely used medication for managing pain and inflammation, with its usage tailored to individual patient needs and regional regulations.\",2\r\n330,塞来昔布,\"**塞来昔布 (Celecoxib)** 是一种选择性COX-2抑制剂，属于非甾体抗炎药（NSAID），主要用于缓解疼痛和炎症，尤其在关节炎等慢性病症中表现出显著疗效。其作用机制是通过选择性抑制环氧化酶-2（COX-2），减少前列腺素的生成，从而减轻疼痛和炎症反应，同时相较于传统NSAIDs（如布洛芬或萘普生），塞来昔布对胃肠道黏膜的刺激更小，因此更适合老年患者或胃肠道风险较高的人群使用。  \n\n在临床应用中，塞来昔布的常见剂量为200毫克，每日两次，半衰期为8至12小时，适用于多种疼痛管理场景，包括骨关节炎、类风湿性关节炎以及急性痛风发作的症状控制。其COX-2选择性特性使其在提供有效镇痛和抗炎效果的同时，降低了胃肠道副作用（如溃疡或出血）的发生率。  \n\n需要注意的是，尽管塞来昔布的胃肠道安全性较高，但仍可能增加心血管事件的风险（如心肌梗死或中风），尤其是在长期或高剂量使用时。因此，临床使用需权衡利弊，并遵循个体化治疗原则。  \n\n综上所述，塞来昔布是一种高效且相对安全的NSAID，特别适合需长期镇痛治疗且胃肠道敏感的患者，但其心血管风险仍需谨慎评估。\",3\r\n328,依托考昔,\"A COX-2 selective NSAID with a 22-hour half-life, dosed at 60–120 mg once daily for inflammation.\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n665,非甾体抗炎药,双氯芬酸,Diclofenac is a type of NSAID,17\r\n673,塞来昔布,双氯芬酸,Both are NSAIDs used for pain relief and anti-inflammatory purposes,5\r\n302,依托考昔,塞来昔布,Both are COX-2 selective NSAIDs with similar uses but differing half-lives and dosing.,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
