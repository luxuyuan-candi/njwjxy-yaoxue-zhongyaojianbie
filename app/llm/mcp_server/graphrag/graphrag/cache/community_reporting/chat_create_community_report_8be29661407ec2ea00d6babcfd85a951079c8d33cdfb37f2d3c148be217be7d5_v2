They function by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure.  \n\nThese medications are rarely metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, meaning they have a low likelihood of pharmacokinetic drug interactions. However, they may exhibit pharmacodynamic interactions with other drugs, particularly those affecting blood pressure or kidney function. Despite this, clinical reports suggest that ACE inhibitors generally have minimal impact on lipid metabolism and no significant clinically relevant drug interactions.  \n\nACEIs are widely recognized as a first-line treatment for hypertension due to their efficacy and safety profile. Their therapeutic applications extend to heart failure management, where they help improve outcomes by reducing cardiac workload.  \n\nIn summary, ACE inhibitors are a well-established class of antihypertensive and cardioprotective drugs with a favorable metabolic profile and limited drug interaction risks, making them a reliable option for patients with cardiovascular conditions.\",11\r\n4957,阿利吉仑,阿利吉仑是一种药物，与ACEI合用可能增加低血压和肾功能损伤风险,2\r\n4921,沙库巴曲 (SACUBITRIL),\"Sacubitril is a drug that, when combined with ACE inhibitors, increases the risk of angioedema\"\"\",1\r\n4923,卡托普利 (CAPTOPRIL),\"Captopril is an ACE inhibitor drug with minimal CYP450 metabolism but potential pharmacodynamic interactions\"\"\",1\r\n4924,贝那普利 (BENAZEPRIL),\"Benazepril is an ACE inhibitor drug with minimal CYP450 metabolism but potential pharmacodynamic interactions\"\"\",1\r\n4925,福辛普利 (FOSINOPRIL),\"Fosinopril is an ACE inhibitor drug with minimal CYP450 metabolism but potential pharmacodynamic interactions\"\"\",1\r\n4956,沙库巴曲/缬沙坦,沙库巴曲/缬沙坦是一种药物，与ACEI合用增加血管神经性水肿风险,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n987,ACEI,ARB,\"**Summary of ACEI and ARB**  \n\nACE inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are two classes of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions. Both are classified as antihypertensive medications and are widely used to manage high blood pressure. While their mechanisms differ—ACEI inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, whereas ARB block the binding of angiotensin II to its receptors—they share a common goal of reducing blood pressure and mitigating cardiovascular risks.  \n\nIn addition to their primary use in hypertension, both ACEI and ARB are prescribed for conditions such as heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and post-myocardial infarction care, owing to their protective effects on the heart and kidneys. Notably, these drugs have minimal impact on lipid metabolism, making them suitable for patients with concurrent lipid disorders.  \n\nDespite their similarities, ACEI and ARB are not interchangeable in all clinical scenarios due to differences in side-effect profiles (e.g., ACEI may cause a dry cough, while ARB are less likely to do so). However, both remain cornerstone therapies in cardiovascular medicine, offering effective blood pressure control and organ protection.
