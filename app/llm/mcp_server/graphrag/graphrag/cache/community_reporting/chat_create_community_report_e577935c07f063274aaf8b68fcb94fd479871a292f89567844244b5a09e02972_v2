They include common drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, aspirin, and celecoxib. NSAIDs serve as a first-line treatment for acute conditions like migraines, musculoskeletal pain, and gout attacks.  \n\nIn the context of **gout**, NSAIDs are frequently prescribed when colchicine is contraindicated or ineffective. They are particularly useful for managing acute gout flare-ups, with both non-selective COX inhibitors (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) and selective COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) being commonly employed. However, their use requires caution due to potential **gastrointestinal risks** (e.g., ulcers, bleeding) and **cardiovascular risks** (e.g., increased blood pressure, heart attack risk), especially with long-term or high-dose use.  \n\nFor **acute pain management**, NSAIDs are often the preferred choice due to their rapid onset of action and effectiveness in reducing inflammation. Drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen, and diclofenac are frequently used to alleviate pain from conditions such as headaches, sprains, and arthritis.  \n\nIn summary, NSAIDs (非甾体抗炎药) are versatile medications essential for treating acute pain, inflammation, and gout, but their use must be carefully monitored to mitigate adverse effects, particularly in patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal or cardiovascular conditions.\",11\r\n221,糖皮质激素,\"糖皮质激素主要用于急性痛风发作伴全身症状或其他药物无效时，推荐短期使用，需注意高血压等副作用。\"\"\",2\r\n229,双氯芬酸,\"**双氯芬酸 (Diclofenac)** is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to treat pain and inflammatory conditions. It functions as a non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, effectively reducing inflammation and alleviating pain. While some descriptions indicate it is available over-the-counter, its regulatory status may vary by region.  \n\nDiclofenac is commonly prescribed for acute pain management, with a typical dosage of 50 mg administered three times daily due to its relatively short half-life of approximately two hours. This pharmacokinetic profile makes it suitable for short-term use in conditions requiring rapid pain relief.  \n\nAs an NSAID, diclofenac shares therapeutic properties with other drugs in its class, such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects. However, its accessibility (prescription vs. over-the-counter) and specific dosing regimens should be confirmed based on local medical guidelines. Overall, diclofenac is a widely used medication for managing pain and inflammation, with its usage tailored to individual patient needs and regional regulations.\",2\r\n233,酮洛芬,\"**Ketoprofen (酮洛芬)** is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for managing musculoskeletal pain and acute inflammation. It is available in both topical and oral formulations, with the topical form specifically targeting localized pain relief. When administered orally, it is typically prescribed at a dosage of 50 mg three times daily due to its very short half-life of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours. This rapid metabolism necessitates frequent dosing to maintain therapeutic effects.  \n\nAs an NSAID, ketoprofen works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin production and alleviating pain and inflammation. Its short half-life makes it particularly suitable for acute conditions rather than chronic use. The topical formulation offers a targeted approach with potentially fewer systemic side effects compared to oral administration.  \n\nIn summary, ketoprofen is a versatile NSAID with applications in both localized and systemic pain management, characterized by its short duration of action and effectiveness in treating acute inflammatory conditions.\",1\r\n238,痛风急性发作,\"Recurrent inflammatory episodes during urate-lowering therapy, preventable with colchicine or NSAIDs.\"\"\",3\r\n222,IL-1受体拮抗剂,\"IL-1受体拮抗剂可作为二线痛风急性发作期的治疗药物，适用于对一线药物不耐受或有禁忌的患者。\"\"\",2\r\n3319,维拉帕米,\"**维拉帕米（Verapamil）** 是一种药物，具有多种药理作用和潜在的药物相互作用。作为P-糖蛋白（P-gp）抑制剂，维拉帕米能够抑制P-gp的活性，从而增加某些药物（如秋水仙碱）的血药浓度，可能导致毒性风险升高。  \n\n此外，维拉帕米与**美托洛尔**合用时，可能对心脏传导系统和窦房结功能产生协同抑制作用，导致心动过缓、血压下降等不良反应，因此需谨慎监测患者的心率和血压。  \n\n同时，维拉帕米与**辛伐他汀**联合使用时，可能增加肌病（如肌肉疼痛、无力）和横纹肌溶解症的风险，这可能是由于维拉帕米抑制了辛伐他汀的代谢酶（如CYP3A4），使其血药浓度升高所致。  \n\n综上所述，维拉帕米在临床应用中需注意其药物相互作用，尤其是与P-gp底物（如秋水仙碱）、β受体阻滞剂（如美托洛尔）和他汀类药物（如辛伐他汀）的联合使用，以避免潜在的不良反应。\",3\r\n228,塞来昔布,\"**塞来昔布 (Celecoxib)** 是一种选择性COX-2抑制剂，属于非甾体抗炎药（NSAID），主要用于缓解疼痛和炎症，尤其在关节炎等慢性病症中表现出显著疗效。其作用机制是通过选择性抑制环氧化酶-2（COX-2），减少前列腺素的生成，从而减轻疼痛和炎症反应，同时相较于传统NSAIDs（如布洛芬或萘普生），塞来昔布对胃肠道黏膜的刺激更小，因此更适合老年患者或胃肠道风险较高的人群使用。  \n\n在临床应用中，塞来昔布的常见剂量为200毫克，每日两次，半衰期为8至12小时，适用于多种疼痛管理场景，包括骨关节炎、类风湿性关节炎以及急性痛风发作的症状控制。其COX-2选择性特性使其在提供有效镇痛和抗炎效果的同时，降低了胃肠道副作用（如溃疡或出血）的发生率。  \n\n需要注意的是，尽管塞来昔布的胃肠道安全性较高，但仍可能增加心血管事件的风险（如心肌梗死或中风），尤其是在长期或高剂量使用时。因此，临床使用需权衡利弊，并遵循个体化治疗原则。  \n\n综上所述，塞来昔布是一种高效且相对安全的NSAID，特别适合需长期镇痛治疗且胃肠道敏感的患者，但其心血管风险仍需谨慎评估。\",3\r\n225,泼尼松,\"A glucocorticoid (5–10 mg/day) used as an alternative for gout prevention when other therapies fail.\"\"\",1\r\n226,依托考昔,\"A COX-2 selective NSAID with a 22-hour half-life, dosed at 60–120 mg once daily for inflammation.\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n156,秋水仙碱,非甾体抗炎药,秋水仙碱和非甾体抗炎药均为痛风急性发作的一线治疗药物，可单独或联合使用。,18\r\n159,非甾体抗炎药,糖皮质激素,糖皮质激素用于非甾体抗炎药无效或使用禁忌的患者。,13\r\n368,非甾体抗炎药,双氯芬酸,Diclofenac is a type of NSAID,13\r\n370,非甾体抗炎药,酮洛芬,Ketoprofen is a type of NSAID,12\r\n162,秋水仙碱,痛风急性发作,Low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg) is used to prevent gout attacks during initial urate-lowering therapy.,10\r\n157,秋水仙碱,糖皮质激素,糖皮质激素用于秋水仙碱无效或使用禁忌的患者。,9\r\n158,秋水仙碱,IL-1受体拮抗剂,IL-1受体拮抗剂可作为秋水仙碱不耐受或有禁忌时的二线治疗药物。,9\r\n2694,美托洛尔,维拉帕米,维拉帕米与美托洛尔合用可能导致心动过缓和血压下降,7\r\n371,塞来昔布,双氯芬酸,Both are NSAIDs used for pain relief and anti-inflammatory purposes,5\r\n164,泼尼松,痛风急性发作,Low-dose prednisone is a third-line option for gout prevention when other drugs fail.,4\r\n165,依托考昔,塞来昔布,Both are COX-2 selective NSAIDs with similar uses but differing half-lives and dosing.,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
