They include common drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, aspirin, and celecoxib. NSAIDs serve as a first-line treatment for acute conditions like migraines, musculoskeletal pain, and gout attacks.  \n\nIn the context of **gout**, NSAIDs are frequently prescribed when colchicine is contraindicated or ineffective. They are particularly useful for managing acute gout flare-ups, with both non-selective COX inhibitors (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) and selective COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) being commonly employed. However, their use requires caution due to potential **gastrointestinal risks** (e.g., ulcers, bleeding) and **cardiovascular risks** (e.g., increased blood pressure, heart attack risk), especially with long-term or high-dose use.  \n\nFor **acute pain management**, NSAIDs are often the preferred choice due to their rapid onset of action and effectiveness in reducing inflammation. Drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen, and diclofenac are frequently used to alleviate pain from conditions such as headaches, sprains, and arthritis.  \n\nIn summary, NSAIDs (非甾体抗炎药) are versatile medications essential for treating acute pain, inflammation, and gout, but their use must be carefully monitored to mitigate adverse effects, particularly in patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal or cardiovascular conditions.\",15\r\n340,痛风急性发作,\"Recurrent inflammatory episodes during urate-lowering therapy, preventable with colchicine or NSAIDs.\"\"\",5\r\n883,肌肉骨骼疼痛,\"Chronic pain condition affecting muscles, bones, joints, tendons or soft tissues, often managed with NSAIDs and physical therapy>\",2\r\n346,胃肠道出血,\"A serious adverse effect linked to NSAID use.\"\"\",1\r\n335,酮洛芬,\"**Ketoprofen (酮洛芬)** is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for managing musculoskeletal pain and acute inflammation. It is available in both topical and oral formulations, with the topical form specifically targeting localized pain relief. When administered orally, it is typically prescribed at a dosage of 50 mg three times daily due to its very short half-life of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours. This rapid metabolism necessitates frequent dosing to maintain therapeutic effects.  \n\nAs an NSAID, ketoprofen works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin production and alleviating pain and inflammation. Its short half-life makes it particularly suitable for acute conditions rather than chronic use. The topical formulation offers a targeted approach with potentially fewer systemic side effects compared to oral administration.  \n\nIn summary, ketoprofen is a versatile NSAID with applications in both localized and systemic pain management, characterized by its short duration of action and effectiveness in treating acute inflammatory conditions.\",1\r\n304,降尿酸治疗,\"降尿酸治疗（Urate-lowering therapy, ULT）是一种针对痛风患者的治疗方法，旨在通过降低血液中的尿酸水平来管理和预防痛风发作。该治疗的主要目标是将血尿酸浓度维持在特定范围内（通常低于6 mg/dL或360 μmol/L），以减少尿酸结晶沉积并防止疾病进展。  \n\n降尿酸治疗在初期阶段可能引发痛风急性发作，这是由于尿酸水平的快速波动导致已沉积的尿酸盐结晶释放，从而触发炎症反应。因此，临床实践中常建议在降尿酸治疗开始时配合使用抗炎药物（如非甾体抗炎药或秋水仙碱）以预防或缓解初期痛风发作。  \n\n该疗法适用于慢性痛风患者、频繁发作的痛风患者，或存在痛风石、关节损伤等并发症的患者。常见的降尿酸药物包括别嘌呤醇（Allopurinol）、非布司他（Febuxostat）和促尿酸排泄药（如苯溴马隆）。治疗方案需根据患者的肾功能、药物耐受性及个体反应进行调整，并需长期坚持以达到最佳效果。  \n\n综上，降尿酸治疗是一种关键的风湿病管理手段，尽管初期可能伴随痛风发作风险，但其长期应用能有效控制尿酸水平，减少痛风复发及并发症的发生。\",7\r\n312,阿尔茨海默病,,1\r\n308,帕金森病,\"帕金森病是一种神经退行性疾病，血尿酸过低可能增加其风险\"\"\",1\r\n307,苯溴马隆,\"苯溴马隆是一种促进尿酸排泄的药物，通过抑制肾小管尿酸重吸收降低血尿酸水平\"\"\",3\r\n310,肾小管尿酸转运蛋白1,\"肾小管尿酸转运蛋白1是尿酸重吸收的关键蛋白，苯溴马隆通过抑制其功能促进尿酸排泄\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n292,非甾体抗炎药,糖皮质激素,糖皮质激素用于非甾体抗炎药无效或使用禁忌的患者。,24\r\n303,痛风急性发作,中华内科杂志,The journal published the 2023 clinical guidelines on gout management referenced in the text.,18\r\n668,非甾体抗炎药,肌肉骨骼疼痛,NSAIDs are a primary treatment option for musculoskeletal pain,17\r\n300,非甾体抗炎药,胃肠道出血,NSAIDs may cause gastrointestinal bleeding as a severe adverse effect.,16\r\n667,非甾体抗炎药,酮洛芬,Ketoprofen is a type of NSAID,16\r\n263,降尿酸治疗,别嘌醇,别嘌醇是降尿酸治疗的常用药物之一,15\r\n266,降尿酸治疗,阿尔茨海默病,降尿酸治疗需注意血尿酸水平，过低可能增加阿尔茨海默病风险,8\r\n267,降尿酸治疗,帕金森病,降尿酸治疗需注意血尿酸水平，过低可能增加帕金森病风险,8\r\n272,苯溴马隆,肾小管尿酸转运蛋白1,苯溴马隆通过抑制肾小管尿酸转运蛋白1来促进尿酸排泄,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
