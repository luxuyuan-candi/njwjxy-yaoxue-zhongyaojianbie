It is designed to simplify treatment regimens by reducing the number of pills a patient needs to take, thereby improving adherence. SPCs typically include antihypertensive and lipid-lowering agents, making them suitable for patients with both high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol levels.  \n\nClinical evidence highlights SPC's dual benefits: it effectively manages hypertension while also addressing hypercholesterolemia, offering a convenient and efficient therapeutic option. Additionally, SPCs are recognized for their relative safety in clinical practice, with no significant adverse effects reported beyond those expected from the individual components.  \n\nWhile the term \"\"SPC\"\" broadly refers to single-pill combinations in pharmacology, the provided descriptions specifically emphasize its role in cardiovascular care, particularly for patients requiring combined antihypertensive and lipid-modifying therapy. The formulations are aligned with treatment protocols aimed at optimizing patient outcomes through simplified dosing.  \n\nIn summary, SPC represents a practical, safe, and effective treatment strategy for managing comorbid hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, leveraging the advantages of fixed-dose combinations to enhance patient compliance and therapeutic efficacy.\",3\r\n2046,匹伐他汀,\"**匹伐他汀 (Pitavastatin)** is a statin drug primarily used for cholesterol management. Classified as a medium-intensity statin, it works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol production in the liver. Pitavastatin is prescribed to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Its efficacy and safety profile make it a viable option for patients requiring moderate lipid-lowering therapy. The drug is available in oral form and is typically administered once daily, often as part of a broader treatment plan that includes dietary and lifestyle modifications.\",2\r\n1360,ASTEROID,\"ASTEROID is a research study that showed rosuvastatin treatment could reduce atherosclerotic plaque volume by 0.79%, fundamentally preventing cardiovascular events\",1\r\n1356,ASCOT LLA,\"A research study that demonstrated the benefits of early statin therapy in reducing all-cause mortality risk in hypertensive patients by 14%.\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2695,环孢素,瑞舒伐他汀,环孢素作为OATP1B1抑制剂，与瑞舒伐他汀合用可能增加横纹肌溶解症的风险,11\r\n2733,瑞舒伐他汀,环孢素,\"瑞舒伐他汀（rosuvastatin）与环孢素（cyclosporine）之间存在显著的药物相互作用。环孢素通过抑制肝脏转运蛋白OATP1B1，显著增加瑞舒伐他汀在血液中的浓度。这一相互作用导致瑞舒伐他汀的药代动力学参数发生变化，具体表现为其血药浓度-时间曲线下面积（AUC）和峰值浓度（Cmax）的升高。由于瑞舒伐他汀的治疗窗较窄，这种浓度的增加可能提高其不良反应的风险，包括肌肉毒性（如肌病或横纹肌溶解）和肝脏毒性。因此，当瑞舒伐他汀与环孢素联合使用时，需密切监测患者的不良反应，并考虑调整瑞舒伐他汀的剂量以降低潜在风险。  \n\n（注：总结已整合两项描述，统一了机制与临床影响，并保持第三人称客观表述，字数控制在500字内。）\",11\r\n944,SPC,瑞舒伐他汀,SPC and rosuvastatin are both used for lipid-lowering and cardiovascular protection,8\r\n2697,环孢素,匹伐他汀,环孢素作为OATP1B1抑制剂，与匹伐他汀合用可能增加横纹肌溶解症的风险,8\r\n945,ASTEROID,瑞舒伐他汀,The ASTEROID study used rosuvastatin to demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing atherosclerotic plaque,6\r\n942,ASCOT LLA,SPC,ASCOT LLA research supports the use of combined therapies like SPC for managing hypertension and lipid levels,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
