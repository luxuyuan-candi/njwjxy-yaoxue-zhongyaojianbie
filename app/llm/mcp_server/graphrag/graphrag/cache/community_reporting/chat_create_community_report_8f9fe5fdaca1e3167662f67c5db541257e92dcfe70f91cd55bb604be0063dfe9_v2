This plaque accumulation, primarily composed of cholesterol, lipids, and other substances, restricts blood flow to the heart, potentially leading to myocardial ischemia, heart attacks, or other life-threatening complications.  \n\nThe disease is strongly linked to abnormal lipid metabolism, particularly elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), as well as reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL). High cholesterol (hyperlipidemia) is a major contributor, with LDL often referred to as a \"\"source\"\" of CHD. Additionally, factors such as diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, age, gender, family history, and unhealthy lifestyle habits significantly influence risk.  \n\nDietary choices play a crucial role in both prevention and management. Reducing saturated fats, avoiding trans fats, and increasing HDL through foods like cornmeal may lower risk. Alcohol consumption and lipid metabolism also interact in influencing CHD progression. Notably, the Inuit population exhibits a significantly lower incidence, possibly due to genetic or dietary factors.  \n\nCHD is exacerbated by conditions like hyperlipidemia and diabetes, which accelerate atherosclerosis. Conversely, lifestyle modifications—such as exercise, balanced nutrition, and smoking cessation—can mitigate risk. The condition is often detected through lipid profile abnormalities and may present with complications like angina, heart failure, or sudden cardiac death.  \n\nIn summary, CHD is a multifactorial disease rooted in arterial plaque buildup, driven by lipid imbalances and modifiable risk factors. Early intervention through lifestyle changes and medical management is critical to reducing its severe health consequences.\",52\r\n1164,PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE,\"A circulatory condition causing narrowed blood vessels, listed as a clinical complication of hypertension\"\"\",2\r\n2396,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,\"**High Lipidemia** is a medical condition characterized by elevated levels of lipids—including cholesterol and triglycerides—in the blood. It is often caused by dietary and lifestyle factors such as excessive alcohol consumption, high-fat diets, lack of exercise, and genetic predisposition. Poor management of these factors can lead to serious health complications, including pancreatitis, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and metabolic disorders. High lipidemia is also a significant global health concern, acting as a \"\"silent killer\"\" and a major contributor to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.  \n\nThe condition is typically managed through dietary adjustments, regular exercise, and medication. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), high lipidemia is classified under categories such as \"\"blood stasis,\"\" \"\"phlegm-dampness,\"\" and \"\"lipid turbidity.\"\" TCM views it as a deficiency-excess syndrome, where phlegm and stasis are the manifestations, while deficiency serves as the root cause.  \n\nGiven its association with multiple systemic health risks, early detection and intervention are crucial to prevent long-term complications. Lifestyle modifications, alongside medical treatment, play a key role in controlling lipid levels and reducing the risk of associated diseases.\",53\r\n2708,VEGETABLE OIL,Vegetable oil is a type of ingredient used in the meal plan,3\r\n2399,KIDNEY,\"In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the kidney is regarded as a vital organ that plays a central role in growth, development, and overall metabolic regulation. It is believed that the kidney's function naturally declines with age, and this deterioration can contribute to various metabolic disorders, including high lipidemia (elevated levels of lipids in the blood). The kidney's influence on high lipidemia is attributed to its role in governing fluid metabolism, where dysfunction may disrupt the balance of bodily fluids and lead to metabolic imbalances.  \n\nTCM theory emphasizes the interconnectedness of organ systems, and the kidney's decline is seen as a key factor in age-related health issues. By impairing fluid metabolism, kidney dysfunction can indirectly promote conditions like high lipidemia, highlighting its broader systemic impact beyond its conventional physiological roles. Thus, in TCM, maintaining kidney health is considered essential for preventing metabolic disorders and supporting overall well-being.  \n\nThis summary consolidates both descriptions, presenting a coherent view of the kidney's role in TCM without contradictions.

Due to its composition, it is often restricted in diets designed to manage high lipidemia (elevated blood lipid levels) because of its potential negative impact on cholesterol levels. Medical and nutritional guidelines frequently recommend consuming animal fats in moderation to help control high blood lipids and maintain cardiovascular health. Both descriptions emphasize the need for careful dietary management when including animal fats, particularly for individuals with conditions affected by cholesterol and lipid levels.  \n\nIn summary, while animal fat is a common dietary component, its consumption should be monitored, especially for those with or at risk of lipid-related health issues, to mitigate adverse effects on cholesterol and overall metabolic health.\",3\r\n2398,SPLEEN,\"In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the **spleen** is a vital organ with key functions in nutrient metabolism and fluid regulation. It is primarily responsible for transforming and transporting nutrients extracted from food, a process essential for maintaining overall health. When the spleen functions optimally, it ensures proper digestion and distribution of nutrients throughout the body. However, dysfunction of the spleen can disrupt these processes, leading to metabolic imbalances.  \n\nOne significant consequence of spleen dysfunction is its contribution to **high lipidemia** (elevated levels of lipids in the blood). This occurs because the spleen's role in fluid metabolism and nutrient transformation is compromised, impairing the body's ability to properly process and regulate fats. In TCM theory, the spleen's inability to manage fluids and nutrients efficiently can result in the accumulation of dampness or phlegm, which further exacerbates lipid imbalances.  \n\nBoth descriptions emphasize the spleen's central role in metabolic health and its link to high lipidemia when impaired. The first highlights its influence on fluid metabolism, while the second underscores its broader responsibility in nutrient transformation and transport. Together, they present a coherent understanding of the spleen's function in TCM and its pathological implications when disrupted.  \n\nIn summary, the **spleen** in TCM is critical for maintaining metabolic harmony, and its dysfunction can lead to high lipidemia through impaired nutrient processing and fluid regulation.\",2\r\n3469,LIPOPROTEIN(A),\"Lipoprotein(a) is an independent lipoprotein that can cause arteriosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and myocardial infarction when levels are elevated>\",3\r\n3331,POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN,\"**Postmenopausal Women**  \n\nPostmenopausal women are identified as a high-risk group for developing lipid abnormalities, including hyperlipidemia, due to hormonal changes associated with menopause. The decline in estrogen levels during this stage contributes to an increased risk of cardiovascular conditions, particularly coronary heart disease. As a result, postmenopausal women are more susceptible to metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, necessitating closer monitoring of lipid profiles and preventive healthcare measures to mitigate these risks.  \n\nThis summary integrates both descriptions, highlighting the connection between hormonal changes, lipid metabolism, and cardiovascular health in postmenopausal women without contradiction. The combined information emphasizes their elevated risk for both hyperlipidemia and coronary heart disease, reinforcing the need for targeted medical attention.\",2\r\n3410,MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,\"**Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack)**  \n\nMyocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, is a severe medical condition that occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked for an extended period, leading to damage or death of the heart muscle. This blockage is often caused by atherosclerosis, a buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which restricts blood supply. Myocardial infarction is a critical complication of coronary heart disease and is frequently associated with elevated lipid levels, including very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a), contributing to its development.  \n\nThe condition is strongly linked to high lipidemia (elevated blood lipids), and lipid-lowering therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction in individuals with coronary heart disease. Additionally, some alternative treatments, such as garlic juice, have been mentioned in relation to managing or mitigating the condition, though further research is needed to confirm efficacy.  \n\nIn summary, myocardial infarction is a life-threatening outcome of coronary artery disease, primarily driven by atherosclerosis and exacerbated by poor lipid profiles. Preventive measures, including lipid management and lifestyle changes, play a crucial role in reducing its incidence.\",11\r\n3423,VERY LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"A type of lipoprotein that carries triglycerides in the blood, often elevated in myocardial infarction patients.\"\"\",1\r\n3744,GARLIC JUICE,\"Garlic juice is taken every other day in appropriate amounts, suitable for high cholesterol, myocardial infarction, and phlegm stagnation patients\",1\r\n2413,SOY PROTEIN,\"**SOY PROTEIN** is a plant-based protein source recognized for its cardiovascular and lipid-management benefits. It is particularly recommended for individuals with high lipidemia (elevated blood lipid levels) as part of dietary strategies to improve lipid profiles. Research highlights its role in reducing cardiovascular risk, with a daily intake of 25 grams suggested to achieve these health benefits.  \n\nSoy protein's efficacy in managing lipid levels has made it a valuable component of therapeutic diets for patients with lipid disorders. Its plant-derived nature also makes it a suitable option for those seeking non-animal protein sources. Overall, soy protein is endorsed for its dual role in supporting heart health and aiding in the dietary management of high lipidemia.  \n\n(Word count: 109)\",3\r\n4077,CORONARY ARTERY STENT PLACEMENT,\"A surgical procedure to open blocked coronary arteries that can be reduced through effective lipid-lowering therapy\"\"\",2\r\n4081,LIPID-LOWERING THERAPY,,4\r\n4078,CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING,\"A surgical procedure to bypass blocked coronary arteries that can be reduced through effective lipid-lowering therapy\"\"\",2\r\n4079,SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH,\"A fatal complication of coronary heart disease that can be reduced through lipid-lowering therapy\"\"\",2\r\n3346,CIRRHOSIS,\"**Cirrhosis** is a late-stage liver disease characterized by irreversible scarring of the liver tissue, which impairs its function. It can arise from multiple causes, including metabolic conditions and chronic alcohol abuse. One contributing factor is **high lipidemia (elevated blood lipids)**, which can lead to **fatty liver disease** (steatosis) and subsequent progressive liver damage if left untreated. Another major cause is **excessive alcohol consumption**, which directly damages liver cells over time, leading to inflammation, fibrosis, and eventual cirrhosis.  \n\nWhile the descriptions highlight different etiologies—metabolic dysfunction (lipidemia) and alcohol toxicity—both pathways result in similar end-stage liver damage. The condition is often asymptomatic in early stages but can progress to complications such as portal hypertension, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Management involves addressing the underlying cause (e.g., alcohol cessation, lipid control) and mitigating further liver injury.  \n\nIn summary, cirrhosis is a severe, multifactorial liver disease with key contributors including metabolic disorders like fatty liver disease and chronic alcohol abuse.

Atherosclerosis is the underlying mechanism that leads to the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. This narrowing, often due to the accumulation of fatty deposits, cholesterol, and other substances, restricts blood flow and oxygen delivery to the heart, resulting in coronary heart disease.  \n\nThe relationship between atherosclerosis and CHD is well-established, with atherosclerosis serving as the principal cause of CHD. The progression of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries directly contributes to the development of CHD by impairing arterial function and increasing the risk of complications such as angina, heart attacks, and other ischemic heart conditions. While other factors like hypertension, smoking, and diabetes may exacerbate CHD risk, atherosclerosis remains the central pathological process driving the disease.  \n\nIn summary, coronary heart disease is a consequence of atherosclerosis affecting the coronary arteries, with the latter being the primary cause of the former. The descriptions consistently emphasize this causal link, underscoring the critical role of atherosclerosis in the pathogenesis of CHD.\",85\r\n963,HYPERTENSION,PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE,Hypertension contributes to development of peripheral vascular disease,82\r\n2071,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE,\"**HIGH LIPIDEMIA and TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE**  \n\nTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers a holistic perspective on high lipidemia, addressing its causes, mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment. According to TCM, high lipidemia arises from imbalances in the body's internal systems, often linked to dietary habits, lifestyle factors, and underlying syndromes such as spleen deficiency, phlegm-dampness accumulation, or blood stasis. TCM categorizes high lipidemia under specific pathological patterns, enabling tailored diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.  \n\nTreatment in TCM emphasizes a combination of herbal remedies, acupuncture, dietary modifications, and lifestyle adjustments. Herbal formulations may target spleen strengthening, phlegm resolution, or blood circulation improvement, depending on the diagnosed syndrome. Dietary recommendations often include reducing greasy or sweet foods while incorporating ingredients believed to regulate lipid metabolism, such as hawthorn, turmeric, or coix seed. Lifestyle advice may involve stress reduction techniques and moderate physical activity to restore balance.  \n\nBy integrating these methods, TCM aims not only to manage lipid levels but also to address the root causes of imbalance, promoting long-term health. This approach contrasts with conventional medicine's focus on direct lipid-lowering interventions, offering a complementary or alternative pathway for patients. The combination of syndrome differentiation and personalized treatment underscores TCM's unique contribution to managing high lipidemia.\",59\r\n3572,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,VEGETABLE OIL,\"Vegetable oil is recommended to replace animal fats in the diet for high lipidemia patients\nVegetable oil is recommended to replace animal fats in high lipidemia diets\",56\r\n2074,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,KIDNEY,\"**Summary of HIGH LIPIDEMIA and KIDNEY in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM):**  \n\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the **kidney** is regarded as a vital organ whose dysfunction can lead to systemic metabolic disturbances, including **high lipidemia (elevated blood lipids)**. According to TCM principles, the kidney governs fluid metabolism and plays a central role in maintaining overall physiological balance. A decline in kidney function disrupts this balance, impairing the body's ability to regulate fluids and metabolic processes. This dysfunction can contribute to the development of **high lipidemia**, as improper fluid metabolism may lead to the accumulation of pathological dampness or phlegm, which in turn disrupts lipid metabolism.  \n\nThe two provided descriptions align in emphasizing the kidney's role in metabolic regulation, particularly its influence on lipid levels when impaired. While the first description broadly links **kidney decline** to metabolic disorders like **high lipidemia**, the second specifies that this occurs through disrupted **fluid metabolism**, further clarifying the mechanism. Together, these insights suggest that in TCM, **kidney dysfunction** is a key factor in the pathogenesis of **high lipidemia**, primarily due to its impact on fluid and metabolic homeostasis.  \n\nThus, in TCM theory, supporting kidney function may be considered an important approach in managing **high lipidemia** and related metabolic disorders. The connection underscores the holistic view of TCM, where organ systems are interdependent, and their dysfunction can manifest in systemic conditions.\",55\r\n3394,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,MIDDLE-AGED MEN,Middle-aged men are a high-risk group for developing high lipidemia,55\r\n2075,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,PHLEGM-DAMPNESS,Phlegm-dampness is one of the syndrome patterns of high lipidemia in TCM,54\r\n2076,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,BLOOD STASIS,Blood stasis is one of the syndrome patterns of high lipidemia in TCM,54\r\n3125,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,PANCREATITIS,High lipidemia can trigger pancreatitis.,54\r\n3126,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,GALLSTONES,High lipidemia is associated with the formation of gallstones.,54\r\n3129,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,DEMENTIA,High lipidemia may increase dementia risk via vascular damage to the brain.,54\r\n3375,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,THYROID FUNCTION,\"Impaired thyroid function can lead to high lipidemia by disrupting lipid metabolism\nHypothyroidism can cause secondary high lipidemia by slowing metabolism\",54\r\n3392,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,THYROID FUNCTION DECLINE,Thyroid function decline can cause high lipidemia,54\r\n3396,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,PEOPLE WITH FAMILY HISTORY,People with family history have higher risk of developing high lipidemia,54\r\n3397,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,XANTHOMA PATIENTS,Xanthoma patients are at high risk for high lipidemia,54\r\n3398,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE,Overweight people are at higher risk for high lipidemia,54\r\n3400,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,DIABETES MELLITUS,Diabetes mellitus can cause secondary high lipidemia,54\r\n3401,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,HEPATIC DISEASES,Hepatic diseases can cause secondary high lipidemia,54\r\n3447,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,ALCOHOLISM,Alcoholism is a contributing factor to late-stage high lipidemia,54\r\n3178,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA,Myocardial ischemia is often caused by coronary heart disease,53\r\n3221,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,FAMILY HISTORY OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE,Family history is a strong independent risk factor for coronary heart disease,53\r\n3222,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,AGE,\"Advanced age (≥45 for men, ≥55 for women) increases coronary heart disease risk\",53\r\n3223,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,GENDER,Male gender and postmenopausal status in women increase coronary heart disease risk,53\r\n3720,CORNMEAL,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,Cornmeal is beneficial for coronary heart disease patients,53\r\n4077,SATURATED FATTY ACIDS,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,\"Saturated fatty acids contribute to elevated blood lipids, increasing the risk of coronary heart disease\",53\r\n4124,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,PRIMARY PREVENTION,Primary prevention aims to reduce the risk of developing coronary heart disease.,53\r\n4125,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,SECONDARY PREVENTION,Secondary prevention aims to manage and reduce complications in individuals already diagnosed with coronary heart disease.,53\r\n4126,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT,This surgical procedure treats severe cases of coronary heart disease.,53\r\n4127,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,CORONARY STENT PLACEMENT,This procedure treats narrowed arteries caused by coronary heart disease.,53\r\n3575,ANIMAL FAT,CHOLESTEROL,Animal fats are a primary dietary source of cholesterol that must be limited,49\r\n2866,SPLEEN,LIVER,\"In TCM, the spleen and liver work together in nutrient transformation and Qi regulation\",23\r\n3266,ARTERIOSCLEROSIS,LIPOPROTEIN(A),Elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) can cause arteriosclerosis,18\r\n2956,HIGH LIPID BLOOD DISEASE,POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN,Postmenopausal women are at increased risk for high lipid blood disease,12\r\n3163,MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,VERY LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,Elevated very low-density lipoprotein levels are associated with myocardial infarction,12\r\n3716,GARLIC JUICE,MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,Garlic juice is recommended for myocardial infarction patients,12\r\n3574,SOY PROTEIN,VEGETABLE OIL,Both soy protein and vegetable oil are recommended plant-based alternatives in high lipidemia diets,6\r\n4120,CORONARY ARTERY STENT PLACEMENT,LIPID-LOWERING THERAPY,Effective lipid-lowering can reduce need for stenting procedures,6\r\n4121,CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING,LIPID-LOWERING THERAPY,Effective lipid-lowering can reduce need for bypass surgery,6\r\n4123,SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH,LIPID-LOWERING THERAPY,Effective lipid-lowering can reduce incidence of sudden cardiac death,6\r\n2986,CIRRHOSIS,EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL,Heavy drinking can lead to liver cirrhosis,4\r\n4151,ANIMAL FAT,EGG YOLK,Both are high-cholesterol foods that should be consumed in moderation,4\r\n2987,GASTROINTESTINAL CANCER,EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL,Chronic alcohol abuse may cause gastrointestinal cancer,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
