It is a primary component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), which are essential for transporting cholesterol and triglycerides in the bloodstream. Due to its involvement in lipid metabolism, APOB is a key biomarker for assessing cardiovascular disease risk, as elevated levels are associated with atherosclerosis and other lipid-related disorders. The *APOB* gene's function underscores its importance in maintaining lipid homeostasis and its potential implications in metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.  \n\nThis consolidated description integrates both the protein's functional role in lipid metabolism and its genetic basis, providing a coherent overview of APOB's significance in health and disease.\",8\r\n1344,LP(A),\"**Summary of LP(A):**  \n\nLP(A), or Lipoprotein(a), is a lipoprotein structurally similar to LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Elevated levels of LP(A) are recognized as an independent genetic risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and other cardiovascular conditions. Unlike other lipoproteins, LP(A)'s association with cardiovascular risk is largely determined by genetics, making it a significant biomarker for assessing inherited predisposition to heart disease.  \n\nResearch indicates that high LP(A) levels contribute to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing the likelihood of heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral artery disease. Due to its genetic basis, LP(A) levels remain relatively stable throughout a person’s life and are not easily influenced by lifestyle changes, unlike LDL-C. This underscores the importance of screening for LP(A) in individuals with a family history of premature cardiovascular disease.  \n\nIn summary, LP(A) is a unique, genetically influenced lipoprotein that independently elevates cardiovascular risk, warranting clinical attention for early detection and risk stratification.\",3\r\n1407,NON HDL-C,\"Non HDL-C is a secondary lipid control target for patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia, with specific target values based on patient risk levels\",2\r\n1409,AORTIC VALVE CALCIFICATION,,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n928,APOB,LP(A),ApoB and Lp(a) are both involved in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk assessment,11\r\n996,NON HDL-C,APOB,ApoB is a better predictor of ASCVD risk compared to non HDL-C,10\r\n997,LP(A),AORTIC VALVE CALCIFICATION,Lp(a) is closely related to aortic valve calcification,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
