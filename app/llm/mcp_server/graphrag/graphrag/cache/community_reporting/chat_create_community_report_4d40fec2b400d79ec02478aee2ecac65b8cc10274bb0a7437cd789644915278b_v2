It serves as a leading authority in setting guidelines for disease prevention, treatment, and public health policies worldwide. The WHO conducts extensive research on a wide range of health conditions, including mental health issues such as depression, to provide evidence-based recommendations and support to member states.  \n\nAs a specialized agency of the United Nations, the WHO plays a pivotal role in coordinating international health efforts, responding to health emergencies, and advancing universal healthcare access. Its work encompasses disease surveillance, health education, and the development of global health standards to improve outcomes for populations across the globe. By bridging scientific research with practical health interventions, the WHO strives to address both communicable and non-communicable diseases, ensuring equitable health solutions for all.\",2\r\n248,美国,\"The **United States (美国)** is a country referenced in numerous studies and reports across various health and medical contexts. Research indicates that when Eskimos migrate to the U.S., their cardiovascular disease incidence increases, suggesting environmental or lifestyle factors may play a role. The country also has a high lifetime prevalence of depression, as noted by the ICPE (International Consortium of Psychiatric Epidemiology).  \n\nThe U.S. healthcare system, often studied for its tiered structure, has been analyzed for potential implications in other nations, such as China. Additionally, the prevalence of gout in the U.S. has risen steadily, increasing from 2.64% (1988–1994) to 3.76% (2007–2010).  \n\nSome U.S. medical reports suggest that low cholesterol levels may correlate with higher mortality risks, particularly among the elderly. Conversely, American scientists have found that elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels may help prevent coronary heart disease. These findings highlight the complexity of health trends in the U.S., where both lifestyle and systemic factors contribute to diverse medical outcomes.  \n\nOverall, the United States serves as a significant case study in global health research, with its population exhibiting varied and evolving health patterns.\",7\r\n247,欧洲,\"Europe (欧洲) is a region referenced in multiple contexts, including research and health statistics.
