Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\r\n1119,SECONDARY HYPERTENSION,\"**SECONDARY HYPERTENSION** is a form of high blood pressure that arises as a direct result of an identifiable underlying medical condition. Unlike primary hypertension, which has no single clear cause, secondary hypertension is attributable to specific disorders, such as renal disease (e.g., kidney dysfunction) or hormonal imbalances (e.g., hyperaldosteronism or Cushing's syndrome). This type of hypertension often requires thorough screening, particularly in cases where blood pressure remains resistant to standard treatments. Identifying and addressing the root cause—such as treating the underlying renal or endocrine disorder—is essential for effective management. Secondary hypertension underscores the importance of diagnostic evaluation in patients with persistent or unusually severe hypertension to rule out contributing medical conditions.\",3\r\n1129,RESISTANT HYPERTENSION,\"**Resistant Hypertension** is a medical condition characterized by persistently high blood pressure that remains uncontrolled despite the use of optimal therapeutic strategies. Specifically, it is defined as hypertension that does not respond to treatment with three antihypertensive medications, one of which must be a diuretic, administered at optimal doses. This condition can be identified through home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) or clinical measurements, confirming the lack of control despite adherence to the prescribed regimen.  \n\nThe two provided descriptions align in their core definition but offer slightly different nuances. The first emphasizes the requirement for a diuretic as part of the three-drug regimen, while the second highlights the role of HBPM in detecting uncontrolled blood pressure. Combining these, resistant hypertension is best described as blood pressure that remains elevated despite the concurrent use of three antihypertensive drugs (including a diuretic) at appropriate doses, with confirmation through either clinical or home-based monitoring.  \n\nThis condition often necessitates further diagnostic evaluation to rule out secondary causes of hypertension, assess medication adherence, and consider additional or alternative treatment strategies. Resistant hypertension poses significant cardiovascular risks, making accurate diagnosis and management critical for patient outcomes.\",6\r\n1199,THIAZIDE DIURETIC,\"**Thiazide Diuretics** are a class of medications primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) by reducing fluid volume in the body. They function as diuretics, promoting the excretion of excess water and sodium through the kidneys, which helps lower blood pressure. Thiazide diuretics are often prescribed as part of combination therapy for resistant hypertension, particularly in cases where other antihypertensive medications alone are insufficient. Their effectiveness in managing hypertension has made them a cornerstone in cardiovascular treatment regimens. By addressing fluid retention and reducing vascular resistance, thiazide diuretics contribute to improved blood pressure control and overall cardiovascular health.\",3\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1005,SECONDARY HYPERTENSION,RESISTANT HYPERTENSION,Secondary hypertension screening is recommended when resistant hypertension is suspected,9\r\n4593,THIAZIDE DIURETIC,RESISTANT HYPERTENSION,Thiazide diuretics are a required component of therapy for resistant hypertension,9\r\n4594,RESISTANT HYPERTENSION,SECONDARY HYPERTENSION,Resistant hypertension may indicate underlying secondary hypertension,9\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
