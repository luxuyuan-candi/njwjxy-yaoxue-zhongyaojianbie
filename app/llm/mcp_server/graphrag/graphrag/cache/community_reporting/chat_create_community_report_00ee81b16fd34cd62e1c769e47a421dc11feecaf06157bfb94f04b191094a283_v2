It affects the pharmacokinetics of various drugs, including simvastatin and dabigatran etexilate, by influencing their movement across cellular membranes. P-gp is primarily involved in the efflux of drugs, reducing their intracellular accumulation and impacting their bioavailability.  \n\nP-gp is inhibited by several substances, such as clarithromycin, cyclosporine (环孢素), and grapefruit juice (葡萄柚汁), which can alter the metabolism and efficacy of co-administered drugs. For example, grapefruit juice significantly inhibits P-gp activity, leading to increased drug absorption and potential toxicity.  \n\nWhile some descriptions emphasize P-gp's role in drug absorption and distribution, others highlight its involvement in excretion and metabolism. These functions are interconnected, as P-gp regulates drug transport across barriers like the intestinal epithelium, blood-brain barrier, and renal tubules, thereby affecting overall drug disposition.  \n\nIn summary, P-gp is a key drug transporter that modulates the pharmacokinetics of numerous medications through its effects on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Its inhibition by certain drugs and dietary components can lead to clinically significant drug interactions.\",17\r\n4893,利格列汀,利格列汀是一种药物，基本不经CYP450酶代谢，是P-gp的底物，与P-gp诱导剂合用时疗效会降低,2\r\n4894,维格列汀,维格列汀是一种药物，基本不经CYP450酶代谢，是P-gp的底物，与ACEI合用时可能增加血管神经性水肿的风险,2\r\n4961,维拉帕米,\"**维拉帕米（Verapamil）** 是一种药物，具有多种药理作用和药物相互作用。作为P-糖蛋白（P-gp）抑制剂，维拉帕米能够抑制P-gp介导的药物外排，从而增加某些药物的血药浓度。例如，它可以显著提高秋水仙碱（colchicine）和达比加群酯（dabigatran etexilate）的浓度，可能导致这些药物的毒性风险增加，如秋水仙碱中毒或达比加群相关的出血风险。  \n\n此外，维拉帕米与其他药物联用时可能产生协同或不良作用。与美托洛尔（metoprolol）合用时，两者对心脏传导系统和窦房结功能的抑制作用可能叠加，导致心动过缓、低血压等不良反应。同时，维拉帕米与辛伐他汀（simvastatin）联用时会抑制辛伐他汀的代谢，增加肌病（如肌肉疼痛、无力）和横纹肌溶解症的风险，因此需谨慎调整剂量或避免联合使用。  \n\n综上所述，维拉帕米在临床应用中需密切监测其与其他药物的相互作用，尤其是P-gp底物药物（如秋水仙碱、达比加群酯）以及经CYP3A4代谢的药物（如辛伐他汀），同时注意其对心血管系统的叠加效应（如与美托洛尔的联用）。合理用药可减少不良反应并确保治疗效果。\",5\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n5108,P-GP,OCT,Both P-gp and OCT are drug transporter proteins,19\r\n5138,利格列汀,P-GP,利格列汀是P-gp的底物,19\r\n5140,维格列汀,P-GP,维格列汀是P-gp的底物,19\r\n5227,美托洛尔,维拉帕米,维拉帕米与美托洛尔合用可能导致心动过缓和血压下降,9\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
