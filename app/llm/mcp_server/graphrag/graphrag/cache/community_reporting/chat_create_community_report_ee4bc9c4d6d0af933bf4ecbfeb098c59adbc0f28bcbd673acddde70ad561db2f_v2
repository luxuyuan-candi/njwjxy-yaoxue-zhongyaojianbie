It is a type of hyperlipidemia and a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and stroke. The condition often occurs in middle-aged and elderly individuals, as well as those with obesity, unhealthy diets, or a family history of hypertension or high cholesterol.  \n\nHigh cholesterol can be classified as primary (genetic) or secondary (caused by underlying diseases or medications). It frequently coexists with hypertension, further increasing the risk of severe complications such as arterial hardening, heart attacks, and strokes. Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is particularly concerning due to its strong association with coronary heart disease.  \n\nManagement of high cholesterol includes dietary therapy, herbal preparations, and lifestyle modifications. It is a primary focus of dietary interventions aimed at reducing lipid levels and mitigating cardiovascular risks. The condition underscores the importance of early detection and preventive care to avoid life-threatening complications.\",38\r\n1448,GUANGZHOU,\"Guangzhou is a major city in China that has been the focus of several epidemiological and health-related studies. It served as a key location for a survey on high cholesterol conducted in tertiary hospitals, highlighting its role in cardiovascular health research. Additionally, Guangzhou was one of the cities included in epidemiological studies on functional diarrhea, underscoring its importance in gastrointestinal health research as well. These studies demonstrate Guangzhou's significance as a hub for medical and public health investigations in China, contributing to broader understandings of both metabolic and digestive disorders. The city's involvement in diverse health research areas reflects its prominence as a center for scientific and clinical studies.\",2\r\n3307,THYROID FUNCTION DISORDER,\"Thyroid function disorders can lead to secondary high cholesterol.\"\"\",1\r\n3309,SECONDARY HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA,\"Secondary hypercholesterolemia is caused by underlying conditions like thyroid disorders, kidney disease, or diabetes\"\"\",1\r\n3745,PEANUT SHELL,\"Dry peanut shells, 50-10 grams, are decocted in water and taken daily, suitable for high cholesterol patients with spleen deficiency\",1\r\n3747,LIPID-LOWERING AND WEIGHT-LOSS TEA,\"A tea made with cassia seeds and chrysanthemum, 5 grams each, decocted and consumed as a tea, has lipid-lowering, weight-loss, heat-clearing, and liver-pacifying effects\",1\r\n3748,THREE MUSHROOM STIR-FRY,\"A vegetarian dish made with winter mushrooms, mushrooms, and straw mushrooms, stir-fried with corn shoots and seasonings, suitable for high cholesterol patients\",1\r\n3749,SILVER EAR STIR-FRIED WITH PORK,\"A dish made with silver ear fungus and lean pork, stir-fried with seasonings, suitable for high cholesterol patients)<|COMPLETE|>(\"\"entity\"\"\",1\r\n3239,FATTY LIVER,\"**Fatty Liver** is a medical condition characterized by the accumulation of excess fat in the liver. It is often associated with metabolic disturbances, particularly elevated levels of triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia) and other lipids (hyperlipidemia or high cholesterol). The condition arises due to dysfunction in lipid metabolism, which leads to abnormal fat deposition in liver cells. While fatty liver can be asymptomatic in some individuals, others may experience symptoms such as liver discomfort or tenderness.  \n\nThe descriptions consistently highlight the link between fatty liver and elevated serum lipid levels, including triglycerides and cholesterol. Though the terminology varies slightly—with mentions of \"\"hypertriglyceridemia,\"\" \"\"high lipidemia,\"\" and \"\"high cholesterol\"\"—the underlying association with dyslipidemia remains clear. The condition may develop without noticeable symptoms, making it a silent but potentially progressive disorder if left unmanaged.  \n\nIn summary, fatty liver is primarily driven by metabolic imbalances, particularly involving triglycerides and cholesterol, and can present with or without symptoms. Early detection and management of associated lipid abnormalities are crucial to preventing further liver damage.\",7\r\n276,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,\"**Cardiovascular Diseases** are a group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels, often linked to high lipid levels (such as cholesterol) and other risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, and hyperuricemia. These diseases are a leading cause of death globally and encompass a wide range of conditions, including coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, angina, myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, hypertension, and cerebral thrombosis.  \n\nThe primary contributors to cardiovascular diseases include elevated lipid levels, which can lead to plaque buildup in arteries (atherosclerosis), restricting blood flow and increasing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Additional risk factors such as diabetes and hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels) further exacerbate these conditions, with studies indicating that hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor associated with increased mortality in both men and women.  \n\nWhile high cholesterol and lipid imbalances are frequently cited as key causes, cardiovascular diseases can also arise from or be worsened by hypertension, lifestyle factors, and metabolic disorders. The interconnected nature of these conditions underscores the importance of managing risk factors through preventive measures, early detection, and treatment to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular diseases.\",15\r\n3368,UNHEALTHY DIET CONSUMERS,\"People who consume high-fat, high-salt, high-sugar diets are more prone to developing high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\"\"\",2\r\n3369,SMOKERS AND DRINKERS,\"Individuals with tobacco and alcohol habits have increased risk of developing high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\"\"\",2\r\n3370,STRESSED INDIVIDUALS,\"People with high stress levels and irregular lifestyles are more susceptible to high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\"\"\",2\r\n3371,FAMILY HISTORY PATIENTS,\"Individuals with family history of hypertension or high cholesterol have higher risk of developing these conditions.\"\"\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2862,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,High blood pressure and high lipidemia are both risk factors for cardiovascular diseases,66\r\n2063,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,HIGH TRIGLYCERIDES,Both are types of hyperlipidemia,44\r\n3332,GUANGZHOU,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,A survey on high cholesterol was conducted in Guangzhou's tertiary hospitals,40\r\n2914,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,THYROID FUNCTION DISORDER,Thyroid function disorders can lead to secondary high cholesterol.,39\r\n2919,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,SECONDARY HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA,Secondary hypercholesterolemia causes high cholesterol levels,39\r\n3718,PEANUT SHELL,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,Peanut shell decoction is used for high cholesterol patients,39\r\n3721,LIPID-LOWERING AND WEIGHT-LOSS TEA,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,The tea is specifically for lowering cholesterol,39\r\n3722,THREE MUSHROOM STIR-FRY,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,The dish is recommended for high cholesterol patients,39\r\n3723,SILVER EAR STIR-FRIED WITH PORK,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,The dish is recommended for high cholesterol patients,39\r\n3013,FATTY LIVER,HYPERLIPIDEMIA,Hyperlipidemia contributes to fatty liver by disrupting lipid metabolism,36\r\n2092,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,SOY PROTEIN,Daily consumption shown to reduce cardiovascular risks,18\r\n3043,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,UNHEALTHY DIET CONSUMERS,Poor dietary habits contribute to development of high blood pressure.,15\r\n3044,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,SMOKERS AND DRINKERS,Tobacco and alcohol use increases risk of high blood pressure.,15\r\n3045,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,STRESSED INDIVIDUALS,Chronic stress contributes to development of high blood pressure.,15\r\n3046,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,FAMILY HISTORY PATIENTS,Genetic predisposition increases likelihood of developing high blood pressure.,15\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
