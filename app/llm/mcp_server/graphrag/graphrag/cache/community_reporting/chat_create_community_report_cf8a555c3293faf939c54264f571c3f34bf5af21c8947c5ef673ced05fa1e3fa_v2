This pathological process is strongly linked to abnormal lipid metabolism, particularly elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Hyperlipidemia (high lipid levels) is a major risk factor, though other contributors include hypertension, smoking, diabetes, and imbalances in apolipoproteins (e.g., decreased apolipoprotein A or increased apolipoprotein B).  \n\nThe disease progresses as lipid deposits accumulate in the arterial intima, forming plaques that can restrict blood flow or rupture, causing acute complications such as coronary artery disease, angina, myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, or peripheral artery disease. Research highlights that atherosclerosis is both a cause and consequence of hyperlipidemia, with statin therapy being an effective treatment to stabilize plaques and manage lipid levels. Additionally, dietary interventions and lifestyle modifications can help prevent or slow its progression.  \n\nIn summary, atherosclerosis is a systemic vascular disorder with significant implications for cardiovascular health, driven by lipid dysregulation and influenced by multiple metabolic and lifestyle factors. Its complications underscore the importance of early detection and risk factor management.\",31\r\n3432,低高密度脂蛋白血症,\"低高密度脂蛋白血症是冠心病的重要危险因素\"\"\",2\r\n3729,同型半胱氨酸,同型半胱氨酸会直接损害动脉血管壁内的内皮细胞，促使血液中的胆固醇和三酰甘油等脂质沉积并渗入动脉血管壁内，形成动脉粥样斑块而发生动脉粥样硬化,2\r\n2508,姜黄,\"姜黄是一种食药两用的物质，具有多种药理作用，尤其在调节血脂方面表现显著。它适用于气滞血瘀型高脂血症，能够有效改善此类患者的症状。研究表明，姜黄能促进胆汁分泌，其提取物对实验性高脂血症动物有明显的降脂效果，可显著降低血胆固醇、三酰甘油和β-脂蛋白的水平。这些特性使其成为治疗高脂血症的潜在天然药物，兼具食疗与药用价值。  \n\n综上所述，姜黄通过促进胆汁分泌和调节脂质代谢，发挥降血脂作用，尤其适合气滞血瘀型高脂血症患者使用。其提取物在降低胆固醇、三酰甘油及β-脂蛋白方面的效果已得到实验验证，展现了其在心血管健康领域的应用潜力。\",2\r\n3940,人工虫草,人工虫草是从青海采集新鲜虫草标本上分离下来的麦角菌科真菌冬虫夏草菌，经培养发酵后得到的菌丝体，能降低血脂，抑制动脉粥样硬化形成>,2\r\n3366,脑栓塞,\"脑栓塞是由动脉粥样硬化斑块脱落导致的脑血管阻塞事件。\"\"\",1\r\n1698,脑出血,\"**脑出血 (Intracerebral Hemorrhage, ICH)** 是一种严重的脑血管疾病，属于卒中（中风）的一种类型，具有较高的致死率和致残率。在不同地区，其发病率存在显著差异：在亚洲国家，脑出血占卒中病例的25%-55%，而在西方国家则占10%-15%。  \n\n脑出血的发病机制与多种因素相关，其中高血压和动脉粥样硬化是主要诱因。高血压可导致脑部血管壁压力增高，增加血管破裂风险；而动脉粥样硬化则可能引发血管壁结构异常，进一步加剧脑出血的发生。此外，研究还表明，脑出血的发病率与血清胆固醇水平存在一定关联，但具体机制仍需进一步探讨。  \n\n作为一种严重的脑血管事件，脑出血常导致突发性神经功能缺损，并可能引发长期残疾或死亡。因此，早期识别危险因素（如高血压、动脉粥样硬化等）并进行有效干预，对于降低脑出血的发病率和改善预后具有重要意义。\",4\r\n3938,大蒜,大蒜的有效成分大蒜精油能阻止动脉脂质增生、胆固醇诱发的β-脂蛋白增加及α-脂蛋白下降，降低主动脉胆固醇含量和主动脉粥样硬化>,2\r\n3384,阿尼斯可夫,\"俄国科学家，1908年首次通过实验证明胆固醇与动脉粥样硬化的关系，提出“没有胆固醇就没有动脉粥样硬化”的结论\"\"\",2\r\n3385,俄国,\"阿尼斯可夫进行胆固醇与动脉粥样硬化实验的国家\"\"\",1\r\n3728,蛋氨酸,蛋氨酸是合成人体一些激素和维护表皮健康必须摄取的一种氨基酸,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2909,高脂血症,心脑血管病,高脂血症与心脑血管病之间存在密切的关联。高脂血症主要通过促进动脉粥样硬化的形成，间接导致心脑血管病的发生和发展。动脉粥样硬化是心脑血管病的重要病理基础，而高脂血症则是其主要的危险因素之一。因此，控制高脂血症对于预防和治疗心脑血管病具有重要意义。,236\r\n3381,高脂血症,失明,高脂血症通过动脉粥样硬化间接导致失明,236\r\n3382,高脂血症,肾功能衰竭,高脂血症通过动脉粥样硬化间接导致肾功能衰竭,236\r\n4050,脑血栓,高脂血症,Hyperlipidemia contributes to conditions that may lead to cerebral thrombosis,236\r\n2717,动脉粥样硬化,胆固醇,胆固醇沉积是导致动脉粥样硬化的主要原因,47\r\n3186,低高密度脂蛋白血症,动脉粥样硬化,低高密度脂蛋白水平与动脉粥样硬化发展密切相关,33\r\n3690,同型半胱氨酸,动脉粥样硬化,同型半胱氨酸会直接损害动脉血管壁内的内皮细胞，促使血液中的胆固醇和三酰甘油等脂质沉积并渗入动脉血管壁内，形成动脉粥样斑块而发生动脉粥样硬化,33\r\n3993,姜黄,动脉粥样硬化,姜黄提取物能降低主动脉中的胆固醇、三酰甘油含量，减轻动脉粥样硬化,33\r\n3996,人工虫草,动脉粥样硬化,人工虫草能抑制动脉粥样硬化形成,33\r\n3032,动脉粥样硬化,脑栓塞,动脉粥样硬化斑块脱落可导致脑栓塞。,32\r\n1448,游潮,脑出血,You Chao is involved in the development of guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH),6\r\n3991,大蒜,姜黄,Both have components that reduce cholesterol and prevent atherosclerosis,4\r\n3075,阿尼斯可夫,俄国,阿尼斯可夫是俄国科学家，在该国完成关键研究,3\r\n3689,蛋氨酸,同型半胱氨酸,蛋氨酸在热理化处理过程中会产生同型半胱氨酸,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
