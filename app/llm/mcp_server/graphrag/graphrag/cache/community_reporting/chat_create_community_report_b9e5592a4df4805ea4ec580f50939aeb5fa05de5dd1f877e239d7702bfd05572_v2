These inhibitors work by reducing the intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol, thereby complementing the mechanism of statins, which primarily inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver.  \n\nThe primary clinical application of cholesterol absorption inhibitors is to enhance LDL-C reduction in patients who do not reach their treatment goals with statins alone. By combining these two drug classes, a synergistic effect is achieved, leading to improved lipid management. This approach is particularly beneficial for individuals with hypercholesterolemia or those at high risk of cardiovascular disease.  \n\nWhile the descriptions emphasize their role in combination therapy, they consistently highlight that cholesterol absorption inhibitors are not typically used as standalone treatments but rather as supplementary agents to optimize cholesterol-lowering regimens. Their use is well-supported in clinical guidelines for patients requiring additional LDL-C reduction beyond what statins alone can provide.  \n\nIn summary, cholesterol absorption inhibitors serve as an effective adjunct to statin therapy, offering a dual mechanism to manage elevated LDL-C levels and improve cardiovascular outcomes. Their role is firmly established in cases where statin monotherapy proves insufficient.\",2\r\n2985,PCSK9 INHIBITOR,\"**PCSK9 Inhibitor**  \n\nPCSK9 inhibitors are a class of drugs primarily used to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in the blood. They achieve this by increasing the removal of LDL from the bloodstream, targeting the PCSK9 protein, which regulates LDL receptor degradation. These inhibitors are particularly effective in high-risk patients, such as those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), where aggressive LDL-C reduction is critical.  \n\nPCSK9 inhibitors are often prescribed in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies, such as statins, to enhance their efficacy, especially in cases of mixed hyperlipidemia or when statin therapy alone is insufficient. Their use is well-established in managing high-risk patients who require additional LDL-C reduction beyond what traditional therapies provide.  \n\nWhile the descriptions vary slightly in phrasing, they consistently emphasize the role of PCSK9 inhibitors in lowering LDL-C, their application in high-risk populations, and their frequent use alongside other treatments like statins. There are no significant contradictions in the provided descriptions, only complementary details reinforcing their therapeutic purpose and target patient groups.  \n\nIn summary, PCSK9 inhibitors are a specialized class of drugs designed to significantly reduce LDL-C levels, particularly in high-risk cardiovascular patients, often in combination with other lipid-modifying therapies for optimal outcomes.\",3\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2511,LDL-C,胆固醇吸收抑制剂,Cholesterol absorption inhibitors help further reduce LDL-C when combined with statins,42\r\n2555,PCSK9 INHIBITOR,胆固醇吸收抑制剂,Both are used as adjunct therapies when statins alone don't achieve LDL-C targets,5\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
