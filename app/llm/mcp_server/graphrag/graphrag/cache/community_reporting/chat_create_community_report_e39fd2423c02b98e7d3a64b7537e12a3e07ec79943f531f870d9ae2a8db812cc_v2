They function by increasing serotonin levels in the brain, which helps alleviate symptoms of depression and other mood disorders.  \n\nSSRIs are frequently considered for use during pregnancy, though certain precautions apply. While most SSRIs are generally not associated with fetal heart disease or death, paroxetine is an exception, as it may increase the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. As a result, healthcare providers often avoid prescribing paroxetine to pregnant patients, opting for alternative SSRIs when necessary.  \n\nOverall, SSRIs remain a cornerstone in depression treatment due to their efficacy and relatively favorable safety profile, though individual patient factors—such as pregnancy—require careful consideration when selecting the appropriate medication.\",16\r\n5263,SNRIS,\"**Summary of SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors):**  \n\nSNRIs, or Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors, are a class of antidepressant medications primarily used for the treatment of depression. They function by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, two neurotransmitters associated with mood regulation. SNRIs are widely recognized as an effective pharmacological option for managing depressive disorders.  \n\nWhile SNRIs are commonly prescribed for depression, some studies suggest they may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous miscarriage, though further research is needed to fully understand this potential risk. The class is also referred to by alternative names, including \"\"Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors\"\" and \"\"Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors,\"\" all of which describe the same group of medications.  \n\nIn summary, SNRIs are a well-established class of antidepressants with a primary role in depression treatment, though their use may carry certain risks that warrant careful consideration, particularly in specific populations such as pregnant individuals.\",12\r\n5269,5-HT REGULATOR,\"5-hydroxytryptamine regulator, a class of antidepressant medications\",1\r\n5283,PAROXETINE,,1\r\n5286,质子泵抑制剂,Gastric protective agents recommended when combining SSRIs with anticoagulants/antiplatelets,1\r\n5264,NASSA,\"Noradrenergic and Specific Serotonergic Antidepressants, a class of antidepressants\nNoradrenergic and Specific Serotonergic Antidepressants - a class of antidepressant medications\",4\r\n5265,TCAS,\"Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) are a traditional class of antidepressant medications historically used to treat depression but now primarily prescribed as a second-line treatment due to their side effect profile and the availability of newer alternatives. TCAs are known for their significant anticholinergic effects, which can cause dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and urinary retention, as well as their potential for cardiac toxicity, including arrhythmias and hypotension. These risks make them generally unsuitable for elderly patients, who are more vulnerable to such adverse effects.  \n\nDespite their drawbacks, TCAs remain an important option in certain cases, particularly when other treatments have failed. They work by inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine, though their mechanism is less selective than that of newer antidepressants such as SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors). While their use has declined in favor of safer alternatives, TCAs continue to be relevant in specific clinical scenarios, underscoring their enduring role in psychiatric treatment.  \n\nThe descriptions consistently highlight TCAs as a well-established but secondary option in modern antidepressant therapy, emphasizing their efficacy alongside their notable side effects and risks. No major contradictions exist among the provided descriptions, as all agree on their classification, historical significance, and current status as a second-line treatment.\",7\r\n5266,MAOIS,\"**MAOIs (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors)** are a traditional class of antidepressant medications used to treat depression. They work by inhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which breaks down neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, thereby increasing their availability in the brain. MAOIs are considered an older class of antidepressants but remain effective for certain patients, particularly those who do not respond to other treatments.  \n\nHowever, MAOIs have significant dietary and drug interaction restrictions. Notably, they should not be combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram, due to the risk of serotonin syndrome—a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin levels. Additionally, MAOIs require strict adherence to dietary guidelines to avoid interactions with tyramine-rich foods (e.g., aged cheeses, cured meats), which can lead to dangerous increases in blood pressure.  \n\nDespite these limitations, MAOIs remain a valuable option in psychiatric treatment, particularly for treatment-resistant depression. Their use is carefully monitored to ensure patient safety.\",6\r\n5270,NDRI,\"Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, a class of antidepressant medications\",1\r\n5281,MIRTAZAPINE,An antidepressant that may improve sleep in elderly patients but may be associated with spontaneous miscarriage risk,1\r\n5282,VENLAFAXINE,An SNRI antidepressant that requires blood pressure monitoring in elderly patients due to hypertensive effects,1\r\n5280,NMPA,\"National Medical Products Administration, which provides safety classifications for antidepressant use during pregnancy\",4\r\n4151,FDA,\"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a federal regulatory agency responsible for overseeing the safety, efficacy, and security of food, drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and other consumer products in the United States. Among its many functions, the FDA evaluates and categorizes substances for their safety, including designating certain ingredients as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS). For instance, in 2000, the FDA listed diacylglycerol oil as a GRAS substance, indicating its approval for use in food products based on scientific evidence. Additionally, the FDA assesses the safety of pharmaceuticals, such as antidepressants, and provides guidance on their use during pregnancy, categorizing them based on potential risks and benefits. Through these regulatory actions, the FDA plays a critical role in protecting public health by ensuring the safety of consumable and medical products.\",4\r\n5274,MAPROTILINE,\"A tetracyclic antidepressant with effects and side effects similar to TCAs\"\"\",2\r\n5285,心血管系统疾病,\"Cardiovascular diseases, which have a high comorbidity rate with depression, increasing mortality risk\",4\r\n5287,米氮平,An antidepressant with good efficacy for cardiovascular patients with depression,1\r\n5288,文拉法辛,An SNRI antidepressant that requires blood pressure monitoring due to dose-dependent hypertension risk,1\r\n5061,FLUOXETINE,\"**FLUOXETINE** is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant used to treat depression and other mood disorders. As an SSRI, it works by increasing serotonin levels in the brain, but this mechanism also carries certain risks. One notable concern is its potential to accumulate as active metabolites in infants, making it advisable to avoid during breastfeeding. Additionally, FLUOXETINE poses a risk of serotonin syndrome—a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by excessive serotonin activity—when combined with other serotonergic drugs such as linezolid. This interaction occurs due to synergistic effects on serotonin metabolism, underscoring the importance of careful medication management when prescribing FLUOXETINE.  \n\nIn summary, while FLUOXETINE is an effective antidepressant, its use requires caution, particularly in breastfeeding individuals and when co-administered with other drugs that affect serotonin levels.\",2\r\n5267,NSSTA,\"Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants, a class of antidepressant medications\",2\r\n5268,MT RECEPTOR AGONIST,\"Melatonin receptor agonist, a class of antidepressant medications\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n5680,SSRIS,SNRIS,\"Both are classes of antidepressants with different mechanisms of action\nBoth are classes of antidepressant medications with different neurotransmitter effects\",28\r\n5715,5-HT REGULATOR,SSRIS,Both affect serotonin regulation but through different mechanisms,17\r\n5731,SSRIS,PAROXETINE,Paroxetine is an SSRI with unique pregnancy risks compared to other SSRIs,17\r\n5745,SSRIS,质子泵抑制剂,Proton pump inhibitors should be co-prescribed with SSRIs when using anticoagulants/antiplatelets,17\r\n5684,SNRIS,NASSA,\"Both are classes of antidepressants with different mechanisms of action\nBoth affect norepinephrine but through different mechanisms\",16\r\n5689,TCAS,MAOIS,\"Both are traditional classes of antidepressants\nBoth are older classes of antidepressants with significant side effect profiles\",13\r\n5713,SNRIS,NDRI,Both affect norepinephrine but through different mechanisms,13\r\n5735,SNRIS,MIRTAZAPINE,Mirtazapine has pharmacological similarities to SNRIs regarding miscarriage risk,13\r\n5736,SNRIS,VENLAFAXINE,Venlafaxine is a prototypical SNRI requiring blood pressure monitoring,13\r\n5687,NASSA,TCAS,\"Both affect norepinephrine but NaSSA are newer with fewer side effects\nNaSSA are newer antidepressants, while TCAs are traditional antidepressants\",11\r\n5737,NMPA,TCAS,NMPA provides safety classifications for TCAs during pregnancy,11\r\n5709,MAOIS,5-羟色胺综合征,MAOIs are strongly associated with causing serotonin syndrome,10\r\n4213,FDA,DIACYLGLYCEROL OIL,The FDA listed diacylglycerol oil as a Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) substance in 2000,8\r\n5720,AMITRIPTYLINE,MAPROTILINE,\"Both are antidepressants, though one is a TCA and the other is tetracyclic, with similar effects\",6\r\n5753,心血管系统疾病,米氮平,Effective antidepressant for cardiovascular patients with depression,5\r\n5754,心血管系统疾病,文拉法辛,SNRI requiring blood pressure monitoring in cardiovascular patients,5\r\n5394,LINEZOLID,FLUOXETINE,\"Linezolid and fluoxetine synergistically increase serotonin levels, raising the risk of serotonin syndrome\",4\r\n5714,NSSTA,MT RECEPTOR AGONIST,Both are classes of antidepressant medications with different mechanisms of action,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
