These medications work by blocking the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that constricts blood vessels, thereby helping to lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the heart.  \n\nARBs are known for their favorable pharmacokinetic profile, particularly their minimal interaction with the **CYP450 enzyme system**, which reduces the risk of metabolic drug-drug interactions. However, some ARBs may still exhibit **pharmacodynamic interactions**, meaning their effects could be influenced by other medications acting on the same physiological pathways. While most ARBs are not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, there is variability among individual drugs within the class regarding their metabolic pathways.  \n\nIn summary, ARBs are widely prescribed for hypertension and cardiovascular management due to their efficacy and generally low risk of metabolic interactions.
