Together, these properties highlight ginseng's dual role in both boosting energy and supporting metabolic functions, making it a versatile and valued herb in traditional and modern herbal medicine.  \n\nThe summary integrates its qi-replenishing and spleen-strengthening benefits with its scientifically noted lipid-lowering effects, presenting a coherent overview of its medicinal applications.\",5\r\n3915,GYNOSTEMMA,Gynostemma is mentioned as a traditional Chinese medicine with lipid-lowering effects,4\r\n2870,SPLEEN DEFICIENCY WITH DAMP ACCUMULATION,\"A type of hyperlipidemia characterized by fatigue, loose stools, loss of appetite, and bloating after meals, with a pale, swollen tongue with teeth marks and white sticky coating\"\"\",2\r\n2891,CHINESE MEDICINE RECIPE GUIDELINES,\"Dietary recommendations for managing spleen deficiency with damp accumulation hyperlipidemia\"\"\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2071,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE,\"**HIGH LIPIDEMIA and TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE**  \n\nTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers a holistic perspective on high lipidemia, addressing its causes, mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment. According to TCM, high lipidemia arises from imbalances in the body's internal systems, often linked to dietary habits, lifestyle factors, and underlying syndromes such as spleen deficiency, phlegm-dampness accumulation, or blood stasis. TCM categorizes high lipidemia under specific pathological patterns, enabling tailored diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.  \n\nTreatment in TCM emphasizes a combination of herbal remedies, acupuncture, dietary modifications, and lifestyle adjustments. Herbal formulations may target spleen strengthening, phlegm resolution, or blood circulation improvement, depending on the diagnosed syndrome. Dietary recommendations often include reducing greasy or sweet foods while incorporating ingredients believed to regulate lipid metabolism, such as hawthorn, turmeric, or coix seed. Lifestyle advice may involve stress reduction techniques and moderate physical activity to restore balance.  \n\nBy integrating these methods, TCM aims not only to manage lipid levels but also to address the root causes of imbalance, promoting long-term health. This approach contrasts with conventional medicine's focus on direct lipid-lowering interventions, offering a complementary or alternative pathway for patients. The combination of syndrome differentiation and personalized treatment underscores TCM's unique contribution to managing high lipidemia.\",59\r\n3958,GINSENG,TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE,Ginseng is a traditional Chinese medicine with lipid-lowering effects,11\r\n3959,GYNOSTEMMA,TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE,Gynostemma is a traditional Chinese medicine with lipid-lowering effects,10\r\n2295,SPLEEN DEFICIENCY WITH DAMP ACCUMULATION,TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE,Traditional Chinese Medicine provides treatment guidelines for this condition,8\r\n2297,CHINESE MEDICINE RECIPE GUIDELINES,TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE,The organization developed these dietary guidelines,8\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
