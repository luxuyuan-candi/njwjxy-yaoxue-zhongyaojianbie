It can arise from multiple causes, including metabolic conditions and chronic alcohol abuse. One contributing factor is **high lipidemia (elevated blood lipids)**, which can lead to **fatty liver disease** (steatosis) and subsequent progressive liver damage if left untreated. Another major cause is **excessive alcohol consumption**, which directly damages liver cells over time, leading to inflammation, fibrosis, and eventual cirrhosis.  \n\nWhile the descriptions highlight different etiologies—metabolic dysfunction (lipidemia) and alcohol toxicity—both pathways result in similar end-stage liver damage. The condition is often asymptomatic in early stages but can progress to complications such as portal hypertension, liver failure, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Management involves addressing the underlying cause (e.g., alcohol cessation, lipid control) and mitigating further liver injury.  \n\nIn summary, cirrhosis is a severe, multifactorial liver disease with key contributors including metabolic disorders like fatty liver disease and chronic alcohol abuse. Early intervention is critical to slow progression.
