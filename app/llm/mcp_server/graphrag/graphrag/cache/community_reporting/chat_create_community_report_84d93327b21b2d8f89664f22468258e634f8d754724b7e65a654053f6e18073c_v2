It is a significant focus of research and clinical practice, particularly in geriatrics, as evidenced by studies published in *Geriatrics* (2008) that explore its causes, assessment, treatment, and management.  \n\nThe condition is also the namesake of the journal *Dysphagia*, which publishes research on swallowing disorders, including systematic reviews on therapeutic interventions. One such review examined the effects of therapy for oropharyngeal dysphagia administered by speech and language therapists.  \n\nPost-stroke dysphagia is a common manifestation of the disorder, often requiring diagnostic assessments such as Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) or Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). Management typically involves a combination of compensatory strategies, rehabilitative exercises, and dietary modifications tailored to the patient's needs.  \n\nIn summary, DYSPHAGIA encompasses both a clinical condition affecting swallowing function and an academic journal dedicated to advancing research in the field. It is widely studied in geriatric and post-stroke populations, with diagnostic tools like VFSS and FEES guiding evidence-based therapeutic approaches.\",13\r\n27,STROKE,\"**Stroke** is a cerebrovascular event and medical emergency characterized by impaired or interrupted blood flow to the brain, leading to cell death and neurological deficits. It is often caused by atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, or vascular blockages, which can result from high cholesterol, high blood lipids (lipidemia), or hypertension. These conditions contribute to the narrowing or occlusion of brain arteries, disrupting oxygen supply and causing severe health complications.  \n\nStroke is associated with a range of physical and psychological consequences, including hemiplegia (paralysis on one side of the body), hand dysfunction, gait abnormalities, and post-stroke depression. These impairments often necessitate rehabilitation, sometimes involving orthoses, to restore mobility and daily living activities. Additionally, research highlights that stroke patients may exhibit lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and dietary modifications can influence risk factors.  \n\nThe condition is a well-documented subject in medical literature, with studies focusing on its epidemiology, prevention, and management strategies. Journals such as *中华神经科杂志 (Chinese Journal of Neurology)* have published research on stroke-related complications like dysphagia and rehabilitation outcomes.  \n\nIn summary, stroke is a serious cardiovascular event with multiple risk factors, primarily linked to high lipid levels, hypertension, and atherosclerosis. Its consequences extend beyond physical disability, often affecting mental health and requiring long-term medical and rehabilitative care.\",62\r\n5471,SWALLOWING DISORDER,\"A common complication of stroke affecting 22-65% of patients, leading to risks like aspiration and malnutrition\",3\r\n5502,SHOULDER PAIN,\"A common complication after stroke that can be managed with electrical stimulation and proper positioning\"\"\",3\r\n28,HAND ORTHOSIS,\"Devices used to correct or support hand function, including fixed and functional types, made from materials like low-temperature thermoplastics or aluminum\"\"\",2\r\n5458,HEMIPLEGIA,,2\r\n5453,GAIT ABNORMALITIES,\"Gait abnormalities are movement disorders affecting walking pattern, common in stroke patients\",2\r\n5503,SHOULDER SUBLUXATION,\"Partial dislocation of the shoulder joint occurring in 17%-81% of stroke patients, often within 3 months post-stroke\"\"\",2\r\n5770,THROMBOSIS RESEARCH,A journal that published research on pharmacological prophylaxis for deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in acute ischemic stroke patients,2\r\n29,WRIST ORTHOSIS,\"Devices used to support or correct wrist function, often used for patients with weak or paralyzed wrist extensor muscles\"\"\",1\r\n36,FIXED-TYPE HAND ORTHOSIS,,1\r\n30,FUNCTIONAL-TYPE HAND ORTHOSIS,\"Hand orthosis using springs/rubber bands as power devices to correct interphalangeal joint flexion contractures\"\"\",1\r\n31,THUMB FIXATION SPLINT,\"Orthosis for stroke patients with severe finger spasticity to maintain thumb position\"\"\",1\r\n32,FINGER ABDUCTION SPLINT,\"Orthosis to fix interphalangeal joints in flexion or extension position\"\"\",1\r\n33,SPRING-TYPE INTERPHALANGEAL EXTENSION ASSIST ORTHOSIS,\"Functional orthosis using springs to correct finger flexion contractures\"\"\",1\r\n34,WIRE-FRAME INTERPHALANGEAL EXTENSION ASSIST ORTHOSIS,\"Functional orthosis using wire frames to correct finger deformities\"\"\",1\r\n35,DORSAL WRIST ORTHOSIS,\"Adjustable orthosis maintaining 40° wrist dorsiflexion for patients with weak extensor muscles\"\"\",1\r\n3399,PATIENTS,\"Stroke patients are mentioned in relation to high-density lipoprotein levels.\"\"\",1\r\n5456,MUSCLE SPASM,Involuntary muscle contractions that commonly occur after stroke,1\r\n5457,MUSCLE WEAKNESS,Reduced muscle strength frequently observed in post-stroke patients,1\r\n5470,SPEECH THERAPIST,A healthcare professional who evaluates and treats communication disorders in stroke patients,1\r\n5472,LATERAL NEGLECT,A post-stroke cognitive deficit that impacts functional recovery if not addressed early,1\r\n5622,CLINICAL REHABILITATION,\"A journal specializing in rehabilitation research, including outcomes of stroke rehabilitation\"\"\",1\r\n5623,BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,\"A multidisciplinary journal publishing research on various medical topics, including stroke\"\"\",1\r\n5624,PM&R (PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION),\"A journal covering physical medicine and rehabilitation, including post-stroke spasticity management\"\"\",1\r\n5625,JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF THAILAND,\"A medical journal publishing research on various health topics, including stroke in Thailand\"\"\",1\r\n5664,FEARON P,,1\r\n5626,RONNING OM,\"Co-author of a study on stroke unit care benefits\"\"\",1\r\n5641,ABDOLLAHI I,\"Researcher investigating muscle strength and spasticity in stroke patients\"\"\",1\r\n5644,MORRIS SL,\"Author of systematic reviews on progressive resistance training post-stroke\"\"\",1\r\n5650,YAMAGUCHI T,\"Researcher investigating electrical stimulation for gait improvement post-stroke\"\"\",1\r\n5653,PICELLI A,\"Researcher studying brain lesion locations and spasticity in stroke\"\"\",1\r\n5656,WISSEL J,\"Researcher focused on predictors of post-stroke spasticity\"\"\",1\r\n5732,CHURCH C,Researcher involved in the study of surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation to the shoulder after acute stroke>,1\r\n5782,FISHER R J,Author of the consensus study on early supported discharge for stroke patients,1\r\n1818,DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS,\"**Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)** is a serious medical condition characterized by the formation of blood clots in deep veins, most commonly in the legs.

It is a diagnostic procedure used to assess key aspects of swallowing, including **penetration** (when food or liquid enters the airway but does not pass below the vocal folds), **aspiration** (when material enters the airway below the vocal folds), and **residue** (remaining material in the pharynx after swallowing). While the VFSS is a critical tool for assessing swallowing disorders in general, it is particularly emphasized as the gold standard for evaluating swallowing function in **stroke patients**, who often experience dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) as a result of neurological impairment. The procedure utilizes real-time X-ray imaging (fluoroscopy) to visualize the swallowing mechanism, providing clinicians with detailed insights to guide treatment and management strategies.  \n\nBy combining these descriptions, it is clear that the VFSS serves as the most reliable method for diagnosing swallowing impairments across various patient populations, with a strong emphasis on its role in stroke-related dysphagia assessment. The summary remains consistent, as both descriptions reinforce the VFSS's status as the gold standard while highlighting its broader applicability alongside its specific importance for stroke patients.\",5\r\n5469,FEES,\"**Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES)** is an objective and clinically valuable method for assessing swallowing function, particularly in stroke patients.

The research highlights Dennis's focus on vascular complications in stroke patients, contributing to the broader understanding of DVT risk factors, prevention, and management in this clinical context. The two provided descriptions are consistent, reinforcing the key details of Dennis's work and his role as a researcher in this field.\",2\r\n1819,PULMONARY EMBOLISM,\"**Pulmonary Embolism** is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the blockage of an artery in the lungs due to a blood clot. This clot often originates from **deep vein thrombosis (DVT)**, where a thrombus forms in the deep veins, typically in the legs, and travels to the pulmonary circulation. Pulmonary embolism is a well-documented complication in patients with **intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)** or **stroke**, as immobility and other risk factors associated with these conditions increase the likelihood of DVT formation.  \n\nThe condition poses a significant risk due to its potential to impair blood flow to the lungs, leading to severe respiratory and cardiovascular consequences. While the descriptions vary slightly in context—mentioning ICH patients, general DVT associations, and stroke patients—they collectively emphasize that pulmonary embolism is a critical secondary complication arising from venous thromboembolism. The underlying mechanism remains consistent: a dislodged clot from DVT migrates to the pulmonary arteries, causing obstruction.  \n\nTo resolve any minor discrepancies, the summary clarifies that pulmonary embolism can occur in various high-risk patient groups, including those with ICH, stroke, or other conditions predisposing them to DVT. The key takeaway is that pulmonary embolism is a dangerous and urgent medical event requiring prompt intervention to prevent fatal outcomes.\",2\r\n5617,AVERT (A VERY EARLY REHABILITATION TRIAL),\"An international trial investigating the efficacy and safety of very early mobilization within 24 hours of stroke onset\"\"\",7\r\n4491,BMJ,\"The **BMJ** (British Medical Journal) is a peer-reviewed medical journal that publishes research articles, including those related to stroke rehabilitation and other medical topics.

diagnostic methods used to evaluate swallowing function, particularly in patients with swallowing disorders such as stroke patients. These techniques are clinically recommended for further examination of individuals who exhibit positive results in preliminary screenings like the water swallow test (Ⅰ级推荐, A级证据).  \n\nWhile both methods serve the same primary purpose—assessing swallowing dysfunction—they differ in practicality and application. VFSS utilizes X-ray imaging to visualize the swallowing process in real time, providing a dynamic assessment of oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases. In contrast, FEES employs a flexible endoscope to directly observe pharyngeal and laryngeal structures during swallowing, making it a more portable and cost-effective alternative.  \n\nFEES is often preferred in settings where radiation exposure is a concern or when bedside evaluation is necessary due to its ease of transport. However, VFSS remains valuable for its ability to capture the entire swallowing sequence, including the esophageal phase, which FEES cannot assess. Both methods are considered reliable and are used interchangeably depending on clinical needs, patient condition, and resource availability.  \n\nIn summary, VFSS and FEES are complementary diagnostic tools for swallowing disorders, with FEES offering portability and cost advantages, while VFSS provides a more comprehensive visualization of the swallowing mechanism. Their selection depends on specific clinical scenarios, but both are endorsed as effective evaluation methods.\",10\r\n4953,DASH TRIAL,MEDITERRANEAN DIET,Both are dietary approaches studied for cardiovascular health benefits,9\r\n5909,PHYSICAL THERAPY,OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY,Both are components of a comprehensive stroke rehabilitation program,9\r\n5988,DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS,DENNIS,Dennis conducted research on the incidence of deep vein thrombosis in stroke patients,9\r\n6000,PULMONARY EMBOLISM,DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS,DVT can lead to pulmonary embolism if blood clots travel to the lungs.,9\r\n6163,AVERT (A VERY EARLY REHABILITATION TRIAL),BMJ,The BMJ published research related to the AVERT trial,9\r\n1567,EUROPEAN STROKE INITIATIVE WRITING COMMITTEE,WRITING COMMITTEE FOR THE EEC,Both are involved in creating European stroke guidelines,8\r\n1568,EUROPEAN STROKE INITIATIVE WRITING COMMITTEE,EUSI EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE,The Executive Committee oversees the Writing Committee's work,8\r\n1569,EUROPEAN STROKE INITIATIVE WRITING COMMITTEE,KASTE M,Kaste M is part of the European writing committee,8\r\n1570,EUROPEAN STROKE INITIATIVE WRITING COMMITTEE,FORSTING M,Forsting M contributes to European stroke guidelines,8\r\n1571,EUROPEAN STROKE INITIATIVE WRITING COMMITTEE,MENDELOW D,Mendelow D is part of the European writing committee,8\r\n1572,EUROPEAN STROKE INITIATIVE WRITING COMMITTEE,HACKE W,Hacke W leads the European writing committee,8\r\n4642,ELMER PJ,OBARZANEK E,Co-authors on a study about lifestyle modifications and blood pressure control,8\r\n4645,OBARZANEK E,VOLLMER WM,Co-authors on a study about lifestyle modifications and blood pressure control,8\r\n5912,OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY,SPEECH TRAINING,Both are components of a comprehensive stroke rehabilitation program,8\r\n5955,FEES,SWALLOWING DISORDER,FEES is an objective method for evaluating post-stroke swallowing disorders,8\r\n6002,EXPERT COMMITTEE,DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS,The expert committee provides recommendations for DVT prevention in stroke patients.,8\r\n6003,REHABILITATION TEAM,DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS,The rehabilitation team helps prevent DVT through early mobilization and therapy.,8\r\n6164,AVERT (A VERY EARLY REHABILITATION TRIAL),INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STROKE,The International Journal of Stroke published the statistical analysis plan for the AVERT trial,8\r\n6165,AVERT (A VERY EARLY REHABILITATION TRIAL),BERNHARDT J,Led research on the AVERT trial for stroke rehabilitation,8\r\n6166,AVERT (A VERY EARLY REHABILITATION TRIAL),LINDLEY RI,Contributed to early rehabilitation trial research,8\r\n6167,AVERT (A VERY EARLY REHABILITATION TRIAL),CHURILOV L,Conducted statistical analysis for the AVERT trial,8\r\n6168,AVERT (A VERY EARLY REHABILITATION TRIAL),DEWEY H,Co-authored studies on early stroke mobilization,8\r\n1576,EUROPEAN STROKE ORGANISATION,KRIEGER D,Krieger D also contributes to ESO guidelines,7\r\n4647,OBARZANEK E,CUTLER JA,Co-authors on a study about dietary sodium reduction and cardiovascular disease outcomes,7\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
