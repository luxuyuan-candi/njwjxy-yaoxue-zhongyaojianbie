It is known to metabolize medications such as **R-warfarin**, **clopidogrel**, **omeprazole**, and **esomeprazole**, among others. As a key metabolic enzyme, CYP2C19 contributes to the breakdown and activation of these drugs, influencing their efficacy and safety in clinical use.  \n\nThe enzyme's activity can be affected by inhibitors, which may alter drug metabolism and lead to variations in therapeutic outcomes. While its primary role is in drug metabolism, CYP2C19 is particularly noted for its involvement in the metabolism of **R-warfarin** (as highlighted in multiple descriptions) and antiplatelet/antacid drugs like clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, esomeprazole).  \n\nThe descriptions confirm CYP2C19's function as a hepatic enzyme with broad metabolic responsibilities, emphasizing its importance in personalized medicine due to genetic polymorphisms that can lead to differential drug responses. No major contradictions exist among the provided descriptions; rather, they collectively reinforce CYP2C19's role in metabolizing multiple clinically significant drugs.  \n\nIn summary, **CYP2C19** is a vital enzyme in drug metabolism, with a well-documented impact on the processing of anticoagulants, antiplatelets, and acid-suppressing medications, making it a key consideration in pharmacogenomics and therapeutic dosing strategies.\",11\r\n4972,维生素K2,\"维生素K2（四烯甲萘醌）不宜与华法林合用，可能影响华法林的抗凝作用。\"\"\",1\r\n4992,卡培他滨,卡培他滨是一种化疗药物，与华法林合用会增加出血风险,1\r\n4993,氟尿嘧啶,氟尿嘧啶是一种抗癌药物，与华法林合用会增加出血风险,1\r\n4994,咪达唑仑,咪达唑仑是一种苯二氮䓬类镇静催眠药,1\r\n4995,三唑仑,三唑仑是一种苯二氮䓬类镇静催眠药,1\r\n4996,阿普唑仑,阿普唑仑是一种苯二氮䓬类镇静催眠药,1\r\n4997,司来吉兰,,5\r\n5093,格列齐特缓释片,格列齐特缓释片 is an oral hypoglycemic agent metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19,2\r\n5017,氟伏沙明,\"氟伏沙明（Fluvoxamine）是一种选择性血清素再摄取抑制剂（SSRI）类抗抑郁药物，主要用于治疗抑郁症及相关心理障碍。作为SSRI类药物，氟伏沙明通过增加大脑中血清素的浓度来改善情绪和情绪调节。  \n\n此外，氟伏沙明对肝脏细胞色素P450酶系统中的CYP1A2具有强烈抑制作用，能够显著减缓茶碱（一种常用于治疗哮喘和慢性阻塞性肺病的药物）的代谢。这一特性意味着氟伏沙明可能与其他通过CYP1A2代谢的药物发生相互作用，导致这些药物的血药浓度升高，从而增加不良反应的风险。因此，在联合用药时需谨慎调整剂量或监测药物浓度。  \n\n综上所述，氟伏沙明既是一种有效的抗抑郁药，又因其对CYP1A2的显著抑制而可能影响其他药物的代谢，临床使用时需注意潜在的药物相互作用。\",11\r\n5029,茶碱,茶碱是一种药物，其代谢和清除率可能受到其他药物的影响。当与氟喹诺酮类药物合用时，茶碱的代谢可能被抑制，从而导致中毒风险增加。此外，与氟伏沙明合用时，茶碱的总清除率会降低，半衰期（t1/2）延长，进一步增加其在体内的蓄积风险。因此，在联合使用这些药物时需密切监测茶碱的血药浓度，以避免潜在的不良反应或毒性。,4\r\n5100,苯妥英,苯妥英 is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19,2\r\n859,奥美拉唑,\"**奥美拉唑**（Omeprazole）是一种质子泵抑制剂（OTC/Rx），主要用于抑制胃酸分泌，治疗胃灼热（心烧）和上腹部疼痛等症状。作为胃酸抑制药物，它通过不可逆地阻断胃壁细胞中的H+/K+-ATP酶（质子泵）来减少胃酸的产生，从而缓解与胃酸过多相关的疾病，如胃食管反流病（GERD）和消化性溃疡。  \n\n此外，奥美拉唑在代谢过程中会与细胞色素P450酶系统（尤其是CYP2C19和CYP3A4）相互作用，可能影响其他依赖相同代谢途径的药物的药效。例如，它会与抗血小板药物**氯吡格雷**竞争CYP2C19和CYP3A4的代谢，从而降低氯吡格雷的活性，影响其抗血小板作用。因此，在联合用药时需谨慎评估潜在的药物相互作用风险。  \n\n综上所述，奥美拉唑是一种广泛使用的胃酸抑制药物，但在临床应用中需注意其代谢途径可能对其他药物（如氯吡格雷）的疗效产生影响。\",5\r\n861,法莫替丁,\"An H2 receptor antagonist (OTC) used as an acid-suppressing medication for heartburn and indigestion\"\"\",2\r\n4964,CYP1A2,\"**CYP1A2** is a liver enzyme primarily involved in the metabolism of various drugs and xenobiotics.

While some descriptions emphasize its role in processing specific drugs like zolpidem, others note its broader function in drug metabolism. There are no direct contradictions in the provided descriptions, but they collectively reinforce CYP1A2's significance in pharmacogenetics and drug interactions, particularly due to its inhibition by fluvoxamine.  \n\nIn summary, **CYP1A2** is a critical hepatic enzyme responsible for metabolizing several drugs, including R-warfarin and zolpidem, and its activity can be significantly altered by inhibitors such as fluvoxamine.
