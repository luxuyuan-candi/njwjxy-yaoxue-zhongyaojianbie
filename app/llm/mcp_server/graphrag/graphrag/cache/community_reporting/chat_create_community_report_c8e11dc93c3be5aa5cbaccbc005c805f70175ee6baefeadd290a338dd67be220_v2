It functions by removing excess cholesterol, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL), from blood vessels and tissues, thereby helping to prevent arterial hardening and atherosclerosis. HDL is often termed the \"\"anti-atherosclerotic lipoprotein\"\" for its role in clearing cholesterol from arterial walls, reducing the risk of heart disease.  \n\nSeveral factors influence HDL levels. Regular exercise and physical activity are known to elevate HDL, while smoking has a negative impact, lowering levels by approximately 0.13–0.23 mmol/L compared to non-smokers. Dietary choices, such as consuming garlic, and lifestyle changes, including weight loss and smoking cessation, can also increase HDL concentrations.  \n\nBeyond cardiovascular benefits, HDL plays a role in broader health contexts, including stroke and hypertension in animals, where reduced levels are associated with adverse outcomes. Overall, HDL is a crucial component of lipid metabolism, promoting heart health by facilitating cholesterol removal from the bloodstream and counteracting the harmful effects of LDL. Maintaining optimal HDL levels through healthy lifestyle choices is widely recommended for long-term cardiovascular protection.\",19\r\n3357,LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"**Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)** is a type of cholesterol often referred to as \"\"bad cholesterol\"\" due to its role in contributing to arterial plaque buildup and atherosclerosis. LDL acts as a transporter, moving cholesterol from the liver and intestines to body tissues. However, when excessive, it deposits cholesterol on artery walls, narrowing and hardening them over time. This process increases the risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes.  \n\nLDL can become oxidized when exposed to harmful substances like cigarette smoke, further exacerbating its damaging effects on arterial health. Lifestyle modifications, including regular exercise, weight loss, quitting smoking, and dietary changes (such as consuming soybeans and other cholesterol-lowering foods), can help reduce LDL levels.  \n\nWhile LDL is essential for transporting cholesterol, its overaccumulation poses significant health risks, making its management crucial for preventing cardiovascular disease. The consensus across descriptions highlights LDL's harmful potential when unregulated, emphasizing the importance of maintaining healthy levels through proactive measures.\",17\r\n3451,LONG-DISTANCE RUNNERS,\"Athletes studied showing improved HDL and reduced LDL levels compared to sedentary individuals\"\"\",1\r\n4107,DARK CHOCOLATE,Food that may help improve cholesterol profile,1\r\n3361,OXIDIZED LDL,Oxidized LDL is a modified form of low-density lipoprotein that plays a key role in the development of atherosclerosis.,2\r\n3452,ROWERS,\"Athletes whose training demonstrated significant improvements in HDL and LDL levels\"\"\",1\r\n4106,AVOCADO,Fruit containing healthy fats that improve cholesterol,1\r\n3350,SMOKERS,\"Individuals who smoke, with studies showing their serum cholesterol levels are typically 10% to 15% higher than non-smokers\",10\r\n3351,NON-SMOKERS,\"Individuals who do not smoke, used as a control group in studies comparing cholesterol levels\",1\r\n3352,RESEARCHERS,Scientists who study the effects of smoking on serum high-density lipoprotein levels,1\r\n3353,LIVER CELLS,\"Cells in the liver that may be inhibited by carbon monoxide, affecting the synthesis of high-density lipoprotein\",1\r\n3354,SYMPATHETIC NERVES,\"Nerves that release catecholamines when stimulated by nicotine and carbon monoxide, increasing plasma free fatty acids\",1\r\n3479,OLIVE OIL,\"**Olive Oil** is a healthy oil known for its beneficial properties, particularly in supporting cholesterol levels. It is a healthier alternative to other oils due to its high content of unsaturated fats, making it a nutritious choice for cooking and culinary uses. Olive oil is especially well-suited for summer salads, where its light and flavorful profile enhances dishes while contributing to a balanced diet. Its combination of health benefits and versatility in cooking solidifies its reputation as a staple in healthy eating.\",3\r\n3922,TRAZODONE,特拉哌嗪 is an α-receptor blocker used to treat high blood pressure and can increase high-density lipoprotein levels,4\r\n2716,GARLIC,Garlic is a type of ingredient used in the meal plan,5\r\n3355,SERUM CHOLESTEROL,\"**SERUM CHOLESTEROL** is a blood lipid component influenced by various factors, including lifestyle and genetics. Studies indicate that smokers typically exhibit serum cholesterol levels **10%-15% higher** than non-smokers, highlighting the impact of smoking on lipid metabolism. Additionally, serum cholesterol levels are affected by **diet, exercise, and genetic predisposition**, which collectively play a significant role in determining an individual's lipid profile. These findings underscore the importance of both behavioral and biological factors in managing cholesterol levels.  \n\nThe combined evidence suggests that while smoking elevates serum cholesterol, other modifiable factors like diet and physical activity, as well as non-modifiable genetic influences, also contribute to its regulation. This comprehensive view emphasizes the need for a holistic approach to cholesterol management, addressing both lifestyle choices and underlying genetic factors.\",3\r\n3663,OATS,\"**OATS** are a type of grain known for their effectiveness in lowering cholesterol and promoting cardiovascular health. They are rich in linoleic acid, vitamin E, and saponins, compounds that collectively contribute to reducing plasma cholesterol levels and preventing atherosclerosis. The combination of these nutrients makes oats a valuable dietary addition for maintaining heart health and managing cholesterol. Their high fiber content, particularly beta-glucan, further enhances their cholesterol-lowering properties.

It is a nutrient-dense food known for its health benefits, particularly its ability to significantly reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. Soybeans and soybean products are valued both for their dietary versatility and their potential to support cardiovascular health by lowering harmful cholesterol levels. This combination of portion-controlled nutritional guidance and heart-healthy properties makes soybeans a beneficial addition to a balanced diet.\",2\r\n3362,CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS,\"Coronary atherosclerosis is a condition where plaque builds up in the coronary arteries, with smoking being a major reversible risk factor.\",2\r\n3478,SUMMER,\"Summer is a season when people can choose lighter cooking methods like steaming, boiling, and cold dishes to reduce fat intake\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2999,HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,TRIGLYCERIDES,HDL levels show negative correlation with triglyceride levels in smokers,58\r\n3174,LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,\"**Summary of LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN and ATHEROSCLEROSIS:**  \n\nLow-density lipoprotein (LDL) plays a significant role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Often referred to as \"\"bad cholesterol,\"\" LDL contributes to the condition by depositing cholesterol on the walls of arteries. This accumulation leads to the formation of arterial plaques, which narrow and stiffen the blood vessels, impairing blood flow. Over time, these plaques can grow, increasing the risk of cardiovascular complications such as heart attacks and strokes.  \n\nThe descriptions consistently highlight LDL's involvement in atherosclerosis through cholesterol deposition in arterial walls, emphasizing its role in plaque formation. While the phrasing varies slightly across sources, the core mechanism remains the same: LDL transports cholesterol to arterial tissues, where it becomes trapped, triggering inflammatory responses and plaque buildup. This process underscores the importance of managing LDL levels to mitigate the risk of atherosclerosis and its associated health consequences.  \n\nIn summary, LDL is a key contributor to atherosclerosis by facilitating cholesterol deposition in arterial walls, leading to plaque formation and vascular dysfunction. Addressing elevated LDL levels through lifestyle changes or medical interventions is critical in preventing or slowing the progression of this disease.\",50\r\n3227,HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,LONG-DISTANCE RUNNERS,Exercise in runners elevates HDL levels,20\r\n4167,HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,DARK CHOCOLATE,Dark chocolate may help increase HDL levels,20\r\n3007,OXIDIZED LDL,LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"LDL can become oxidized when exposed to smoke, forming oxidized LDL.\",19\r\n3225,LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,ROWERS,Rowers' training reduces LDL levels,18\r\n4164,LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,AVOCADO,Avocados help reduce LDL cholesterol,18\r\n2989,SMOKERS,NON-SMOKERS,Smokers have higher serum cholesterol levels compared to non-smokers,11\r\n2990,SMOKERS,RESEARCHERS,Researchers have found that smokers have lower serum high-density lipoprotein levels,11\r\n2991,SMOKERS,LIVER CELLS,Carbon monoxide from smoking may inhibit liver cells from synthesizing high-density lipoprotein,11\r\n2993,SMOKERS,SYMPATHETIC NERVES,\"Nicotine and carbon monoxide stimulate sympathetic nerves to release catecholamines, increasing plasma free fatty acids\",11\r\n3290,OLIVE OIL,BLOOD CHOLESTEROL,Olive oil helps improve blood cholesterol levels,9\r\n3962,TRAZODONE,GINSENG,Both特拉哌嗪 and人参 are mentioned as having lipid-lowering effects,9\r\n4155,GARLIC,ONION,Both have properties that help in managing cholesterol levels,9\r\n3272,SERUM CHOLESTEROL,EXERCISE,Exercise reduces harmful cholesterol levels,8\r\n3580,OATS,GARLIC,Both oats and garlic have components that help in reducing cholesterol and preventing atherosclerosis.,7\r\n4153,GREEN TEA,GARLIC,Both have properties that help in lowering blood lipids,7\r\n4157,SOYBEAN,MUSHROOM,Both can significantly reduce cholesterol in the blood,5\r\n3008,OXIDIZED LDL,CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS,Oxidized LDL contributes to the development of coronary atherosclerosis.,4\r\n3289,SUMMER,OLIVE OIL,Summer is a good time to use olive oil for lighter meals like salads,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
