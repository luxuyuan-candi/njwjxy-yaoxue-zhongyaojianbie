Key features of the condition include elevated aldosterone levels, suppressed renin activity, and an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. While hypokalemia is a common symptom, not all patients may present with it.

Additionally, **低钾血症** is also observed in some individuals with **primary aldosteronism**, a disorder marked by excessive aldosterone secretion, which leads to increased potassium excretion.
