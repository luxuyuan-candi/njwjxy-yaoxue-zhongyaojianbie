It plays a significant role in the development of cardiovascular diseases, particularly when levels are elevated. High LDL levels are strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis, as the lipoprotein tends to deposit cholesterol on arterial walls, leading to plaque formation and arterial narrowing. This process contributes to coronary heart disease, stroke, and other vascular complications.  \n\n医学上，低密度脂蛋白被视为动脉粥样硬化和心血管疾病的重要危险因素。其增多会促进胆固醇在血管壁的沉积，加速动脉粥样硬化斑块的形成，从而引发冠心病、脑卒中等严重疾病。由于这一特性，LDL被广泛认为是一种有害的脂蛋白，是心血管疾病的“罪魁祸首”之一。  \n\nWhile LDL is essential for lipid transport, excessive levels disrupt normal metabolic processes, making it a key biomarker in assessing cardiovascular risk. Monitoring and managing LDL levels through lifestyle changes or medication is crucial in preventing atherosclerosis and related conditions. The consensus across medical literature emphasizes LDL's detrimental effects when unregulated, reinforcing its classification as \"\"bad cholesterol.\"\"\",9\r\n2152,冠心病,\"**Coronary Heart Disease (冠心病)** is a cardiovascular disease caused by atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries, leading to reduced blood flow to the heart. It is a severe condition that poses a significant threat to human health and life, with mortality rates in developed countries exceeding the combined mortality rates of all cancers, accounting for 27.4% of total deaths. In China, while rural areas have lower incidence rates, major cities like Beijing and Shanghai are increasingly approaching rates seen in Western nations.  \n\n冠心病 is closely associated with dyslipidemia, particularly elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which are major independent risk factors. Other contributing factors include hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and smoking. The disease manifests as unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, or sudden cardiac death.  \n\nLong-term lipid-lowering treatment is critical for prevention and management, as controlling lipid levels can delay or prevent the progression of atherosclerosis. Statins and other lipid-lowering therapies are central to modern treatment strategies, alongside lifestyle modifications such as exercise, which improves myocardial function and promotes collateral circulation. Notably, the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines equate the cardiovascular risk of 冠心病 in dyslipidemic patients to that of diabetes.  \n\nWhile high cholesterol is a primary risk factor, extremely low cholesterol levels in elderly patients may also pose concerns. The disease underscores the importance of comprehensive risk factor management, with lipid control being one of the three key modern therapeutic approaches.  \n\nIn summary, 冠心病 is an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with a strong link to dyslipidemia, requiring strict lipid management, lifestyle adjustments, and medical interventions to mitigate its life-threatening complications.\",27\r\n2044,氟伐他汀,\"氟伐他汀（Fluvastatin），商品名来适可，是一种中等强度的他汀类药物，主要用于治疗高胆固醇血症或以胆固醇升高为主的混合型高脂血症。该药物的推荐剂量为20～80毫克，每日一次，通常建议在晚间服用。  \n\n作为他汀类药物的一员，氟伐他汀通过抑制HMG-CoA还原酶来降低胆固醇合成，从而有效减少低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL-C）水平，同时适度提高高密度脂蛋白胆固醇（HDL-C）。其中等强度的降脂效果使其适用于需要温和至中度胆固醇管理的患者。临床使用中，医生会根据患者的具体情况调整剂量，以确保疗效与安全性的平衡。  \n\n氟伐他汀的常见剂型包括胶囊和缓释片，其中缓释制剂可延长药物作用时间，提高患者依从性。与其他他汀类药物相比，氟伐他汀的药物相互作用风险较低，但仍需注意与某些抗凝药或免疫抑制剂的联用可能。总体而言，氟伐他汀是一种安全有效的降脂药物，广泛用于心血管疾病的预防和管理。\",3\r\n2158,他汀革命,“他汀革命”是指使用他汀类药物防治冠心病的重大进展,1\r\n2159,血脂革命,“血脂革命”是指通过控制血脂来构筑冠心病防线的重要措施,1\r\n2321,心绞痛,\"心绞痛是由于心肌缺血导致的胸痛症状，通常与冠心病相关。\"\"\",1\r\n2325,载脂蛋白A1,\"载脂蛋白A1具有保护动脉内皮的作用，能促进胆固醇代谢，防止动脉粥样硬化\"\"\",1\r\n2380,冠状动脉腔内成形术,\"冠状动脉腔内成形术是一种治疗冠心病的手术方法\"\"\",1\r\n2381,冠状动脉旁路移植术,\"冠状动脉旁路移植术是一种治疗冠心病的手术方法\"\"\",1\r\n2747,一过性脑缺血发作,\"TIA is a temporary period of symptoms similar to those of a stroke, often associated with high levels of oxidized LDL\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1600,高脂血症,运动锻炼,运动锻炼可以改善血脂代谢，是高脂血症的积极防治措施之一。,112\r\n1562,低密度脂蛋白,冠心病,\"低密度脂蛋白（LDL）是一种与心血管健康密切相关的脂蛋白，其水平升高被认为是冠心病发生和发展的重要危险因素。研究表明，低密度脂蛋白增多会显著增加个体患冠心病的风险，因其容易沉积在动脉血管壁上，形成动脉粥样硬化斑块，从而引发或加剧冠心病的病理进程。  \n\n作为促使心血管疾病发生的“罪魁祸首”，低密度脂蛋白通过其在血管内皮下的积累，促进炎症反应和斑块形成，最终可能导致冠状动脉狭窄或阻塞，引发心肌缺血甚至心肌梗死。因此，临床医学通常将控制低密度脂蛋白水平作为预防和治疗冠心病的关键策略之一。  \n\n综上所述，低密度脂蛋白与冠心病之间存在明确的因果关系，其异常升高是冠心病的重要预测指标和干预靶点。\",36\r\n1787,氟伐他汀,冠心病,氟伐他汀能降低胆固醇，从而预防冠心病,30\r\n1476,冠心病,他汀革命,“他汀革命”通过使用他汀类药物防治冠心病,28\r\n1477,冠心病,血脂革命,“血脂革命”通过控制血脂构筑冠心病防线,28\r\n1735,冠心病,心绞痛,冠心病可能导致心绞痛,28\r\n1745,载脂蛋白A1,冠心病,载脂蛋白A1水平下降易发生冠心病,28\r\n1830,冠心病,冠状动脉腔内成形术,冠状动脉腔内成形术用于治疗冠心病,28\r\n1831,冠心病,冠状动脉旁路移植术,冠状动脉旁路移植术用于治疗冠心病,28\r\n2116,低密度脂蛋白,一过性脑缺血发作,Oxidized LDL is associated with TIA patients,10\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
