Clinical findings include active bowel sounds and the absence of abdominal tenderness or masses. It is classified under ICD-11 with the code **DD91.2**.  \n\n**Functional Dyspepsia (FDr)**, on the other hand, is a gastrointestinal disorder with an unclear etiology. Potential contributing factors include gastrointestinal motility abnormalities, heightened visceral sensitivity, intestinal flora imbalance, food allergies or intolerances, and psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, and depression.  \n\nWhile both conditions share the abbreviation \"\"FDr,\"\" they represent separate clinical entities with distinct diagnostic criteria and pathophysiological mechanisms. Functional Diarrhea primarily involves altered bowel habits without pain, whereas Functional Dyspepsia is associated with upper gastrointestinal symptoms and multifactorial causes. The term \"\"FDR\"\" should be clarified based on clinical context to avoid confusion between these two conditions.  \n\nThis summary reconciles the provided descriptions by distinguishing between the two disorders while acknowledging their shared medical and research framework.\",8\r\n1123,CT,\"**Computed Tomography (CT)** is a diagnostic imaging technique used to visualize internal organs and structures in the human body. It is widely employed in medical settings to diagnose a variety of conditions by generating detailed cross-sectional images of tissues, bones, and blood vessels. While CT scans are highly effective for many diagnostic purposes, they are less effective than Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in detecting chronic bleeding and cerebrovascular malformations. Despite this limitation, CT remains a valuable tool in clinical practice due to its speed, accessibility, and ability to provide clear images of complex anatomical structures.  \n\nIn summary, CT is a versatile medical imaging technique with broad diagnostic applications, though its effectiveness varies depending on the clinical context, particularly when compared to MRI for certain neurological conditions.\",2\r\n1120,ICD-11,\"The International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11), is a global standard for diagnostic health information.\"\"\",1\r\n1121,X线钡灌肠,\"X-ray barium enema is a diagnostic procedure used to examine the colon and rectum for abnormalities such as tumors, polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease.\"\"\",1\r\n1122,肠镜,\"Colonoscopy is a diagnostic procedure used to examine the colon and rectum for abnormalities such as tumors, polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease.\"\"\",1\r\n1124,PET,\"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a diagnostic imaging technique used to visualize metabolic processes in the body.\"\"\",1\r\n1157,四君子汤,\"A traditional Chinese medicine formula used as a base treatment for FDr, often combined with other symptoms for辨证加减 (syndrome differentiation and modification).\"\"\",1\r\n1158,理中汤,\"Another traditional Chinese medicine formula used as a base treatment for FDr, often combined with other symptoms for辨证加减 (syndrome differentiation and modification).\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n746,FDR,CT,CT is used to exclude organic lesions in FDr diagnosis,10\r\n743,FDR,ICD-11,FDr is coded as DD91.2 in ICD-11,9\r\n744,FDR,X线钡灌肠,X-ray barium enema is used to exclude organic lesions in FDr diagnosis,9\r\n745,FDR,肠镜,Colonoscopy is used to exclude organic lesions in FDr diagnosis,9\r\n748,FDR,PET,PET is used to exclude organic lesions in FDr diagnosis,9\r\n774,FDR,四君子汤,四君子汤 is used as a base treatment for FDr,9\r\n775,FDR,理中汤,理中汤 is used as a base treatment for FDr,9\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
