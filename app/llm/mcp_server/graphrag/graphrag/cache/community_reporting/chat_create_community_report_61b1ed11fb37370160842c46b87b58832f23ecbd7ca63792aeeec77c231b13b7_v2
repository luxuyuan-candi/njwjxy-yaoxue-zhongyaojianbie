This class includes drugs such as fluoxetine and sertraline. SSRIs are frequently prescribed during pregnancy, with the exception of paroxetine, which may increase the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. Overall, SSRIs are widely recognized for their efficacy in managing mood disorders while being generally considered safe for use in most cases, though specific medications within the class may carry additional risks in certain populations.\",19\n110,SNRIS,\"**Summary of SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors):**  \n\nSNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors) are a class of antidepressant medications used to treat depression and anxiety disorders. Key drugs in this class include venlafaxine (文拉法辛) and duloxetine (度洛西汀). SNRIs work by inhibiting the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, thereby increasing their levels in the brain to improve mood and emotional regulation.  \n\nWhile effective for mental health conditions, some studies suggest that SNRIs may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) during pregnancy. However, further research is needed to fully understand this potential risk.  \n\nOverall, SNRIs are widely recognized as an important pharmacological option for managing depression and anxiety, with venlafaxine and duloxetine being among the most commonly prescribed medications in this class.\",12\n159,PAROXETINE,,2\n163,糖尿病,糖尿病是一种代谢性疾病，常与其他健康问题共存。研究表明，糖尿病可能与抑郁症共病，同时也被指出是痛风患者可能伴发的代谢综合征表现之一。这些描述共同强调了糖尿病作为一种复杂的代谢紊乱，不仅涉及血糖调节异常，还可能与其他代谢和心理健康问题相互关联。,2\n121,5-羟色胺综合征,,1\n149,FLUOXETINE,An SSRI antidepressant to avoid during breastfeeding due to metabolite accumulation in infants,1\n161,卒中后抑郁,\"Depression occurring after a stroke, affecting 30%-40% of stroke survivors\"\"\",1\n162,心血管系统疾病,\"Cardiovascular diseases often comorbid with depression\"\"\",1\n164,质子泵抑制剂,\"A class of drugs used to protect the stomach when combining SSRIs with anticoagulants\"\"\",1\n165,细胞色素酶系,\"Enzyme system involved in drug metabolism interactions between SSRIs and cardiovascular drugs\"\"\",1\n4373,CONSENSUS WRITING EXPERT GROUP,A multidisciplinary Chinese expert group formed to develop the 2024 consensus on mixed hyperlipidemia management,4\n68,CHINESE JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE,\"The **Chinese Journal of General Practice** is a medical journal dedicated to publishing research, articles, and guidelines related to general practice. Its scope encompasses a wide range of topics, including mental health, antidepressant drug usage, and blood lipid management. Notably, the December 2021 issue (Volume 20, Issue 12) featured research on general practice. In 2024, the journal published two significant consensus documents: the **Chinese expert consensus on adult blood lipid management in communities** and the **Chinese expert consensus on mixed hyperlipidemia**, highlighting its role in disseminating authoritative clinical guidance.

The descriptions collectively emphasize its role as a TCA while acknowledging its potential for notable side effects.\",3\n152,VENLAFAXINE,\"**Venlafaxine** is an SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) antidepressant that primarily affects serotonin levels in the brain. It is known to increase vascular sensitivity and may also elevate blood pressure, particularly in elderly patients. The drug's dual mechanism of action on both serotonin and norepinephrine pathways contributes to its therapeutic effects as an antidepressant while also accounting for its potential cardiovascular side effects.\",4\n112,TCAS,\"**Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)** are a traditional class of older antidepressant medications, including compounds such as amitriptyline and imipramine. While historically significant, TCAs are now generally considered a second-line treatment for depression due to their side effect profile. They are known to have significant anticholinergic effects and carry a risk of cardiac toxicity, making them less suitable for elderly patients. Additionally, drug interactions may occur, such as increased blood concentrations when TCAs are co-administered with fluvoxamine. Despite their limitations, TCAs remain an important part of psychiatric pharmacotherapy in specific clinical scenarios.  \n\n*(Note: The Chinese text translates to \"\"Tricyclic antidepressants, which may have increased blood concentrations when used with fluvoxamine.\"\" This has been incorporated into the summary.)*\",10\n113,MAOIS,\"**MAOIs (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors)** are a traditional and older class of antidepressant medications, which include drugs such as phenelzine and tranylcypromine. As a class of antidepressants, MAOIs work by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. It is important to exercise caution when combining MAOIs with other medications, particularly SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), due to potential interactions that may lead to adverse effects. The need for careful monitoring and dosage adjustments underscores the importance of medical supervision when using MAOIs in treatment regimens.  \n\n(Note: The third description provided was in Chinese, stating that MAOIs require special attention when used in combination with SSRIs, which aligns with the known pharmacological precautions for this drug class.
