It is particularly valuable for examining soft tissues, making it a critical tool in diagnosing a variety of conditions. MRI is employed in the assessment of **primary aldosteronism** and **pheochromocytoma complications** in hypertensive patients, aiding in the identification of adrenal gland abnormalities. Additionally, it is highly effective in detecting **chronic bleeding** and **cerebrovascular malformations**, providing detailed insights into vascular and neurological disorders.  \n\nAs a non-invasive imaging modality, MRI utilizes magnetic fields and radio waves to generate high-resolution images, offering superior contrast between different tissues compared to other techniques like CT scans. Its versatility makes it indispensable in neurology, cardiology, oncology, and musculoskeletal imaging. By combining anatomical and functional information, MRI supports accurate diagnosis and treatment planning across multiple medical specialties.  \n\nIn summary, MRI serves as a comprehensive imaging solution for both structural and functional evaluation, with applications ranging from endocrine disorders (e.g., adrenal tumors) to cerebrovascular and neurological conditions. Its precision and safety (lacking ionizing radiation) reinforce its widespread use in modern medicine.\",8\r\n1119,FDR,\"**Summary of FDR (Functional Diarrhea and Functional Dyspepsia):**  \n\nFDR refers to two distinct gastrointestinal disorders discussed in the context of traditional Chinese medicine and evidence-based research: **Functional Diarrhea (FDr)** and **Functional Dyspepsia (FDr)**.  \n\n**Functional Diarrhea (FDr)** is characterized by loose or watery stools without abdominal pain or discomfort. Clinical findings include active bowel sounds and the absence of abdominal tenderness or masses. It is classified under ICD-11 with the code **DD91.2**.  \n\n**Functional Dyspepsia (FDr)**, on the other hand, is a gastrointestinal disorder with an unclear etiology. Potential contributing factors include gastrointestinal motility abnormalities, heightened visceral sensitivity, intestinal flora imbalance, food allergies or intolerances, and psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, and depression.  \n\nWhile both conditions share the abbreviation \"\"FDr,\"\" they represent separate clinical entities with distinct diagnostic criteria and pathophysiological mechanisms. Functional Diarrhea primarily involves altered bowel habits without pain, whereas Functional Dyspepsia is associated with upper gastrointestinal symptoms and multifactorial causes. The term \"\"FDR\"\" should be clarified based on clinical context to avoid confusion between these two conditions.  \n\nThis summary reconciles the provided descriptions by distinguishing between the two disorders while acknowledging their shared medical and research framework.\",8\r\n1123,CT,\"**Computed Tomography (CT)** is a diagnostic imaging technique used to visualize internal organs and structures in the human body. It is widely employed in medical settings to diagnose a variety of conditions by generating detailed cross-sectional images of tissues, bones, and blood vessels. While CT scans are highly effective for many diagnostic purposes, they are less effective than Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in detecting chronic bleeding and cerebrovascular malformations. Despite this limitation, CT remains a valuable tool in clinical practice due to its speed, accessibility, and ability to provide clear images of complex anatomical structures.  \n\nIn summary, CT is a versatile medical imaging technique with broad diagnostic applications, though its effectiveness varies depending on the clinical context, particularly when compared to MRI for certain neurological conditions.\",2\r\n1120,ICD-11,\"The International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11), is a global standard for diagnostic health information.\"\"\",1\r\n1121,X线钡灌肠,\"X-ray barium enema is a diagnostic procedure used to examine the colon and rectum for abnormalities such as tumors, polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease.\"\"\",1\r\n1122,肠镜,\"Colonoscopy is a diagnostic procedure used to examine the colon and rectum for abnormalities such as tumors, polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease.\"\"\",1\r\n1124,PET,\"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a diagnostic imaging technique used to visualize metabolic processes in the body.\"\"\",1\r\n1157,四君子汤,\"A traditional Chinese medicine formula used as a base treatment for FDr, often combined with other symptoms for辨证加减 (syndrome differentiation and modification).\"\"\",1\r\n1158,理中汤,\"Another traditional Chinese medicine formula used as a base treatment for FDr, often combined with other symptoms for辨证加减 (syndrome differentiation and modification).\"\"\",1\r\n1235,DWI,\"Diffusion Weighted Imaging is a mode of MRI that measures the diffusion of water molecules in tissues, providing additional information for diagnosing ICH>\",1\r\n1236,PWI,\"Perfusion Weighted Imaging is a mode of MRI that measures blood flow in tissues, providing additional information for diagnosing ICH>\",1\r\n1237,FLAIR,\"Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery is a mode of MRI that suppresses the signal from fluids to better visualize other tissues, providing additional information for diagnosing ICH>\",1\r\n1238,GRE,\"Gradient Echo Sequence is a mode of MRI that is sensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneities, providing additional information for diagnosing ICH>\",1\r\n1239,SWI,Susceptibility Weighted Imaging is a mode of MRI that is sensitive to early ICH and microbleeds>,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n531,MRI,TC,MRI and TC are both related to the diagnosis and risk assessment of hypertension,12\r\n746,FDR,CT,CT is used to exclude organic lesions in FDr diagnosis,10\r\n743,FDR,ICD-11,FDr is coded as DD91.2 in ICD-11,9\r\n744,FDR,X线钡灌肠,X-ray barium enema is used to exclude organic lesions in FDr diagnosis,9\r\n745,FDR,肠镜,Colonoscopy is used to exclude organic lesions in FDr diagnosis,9\r\n748,FDR,PET,PET is used to exclude organic lesions in FDr diagnosis,9\r\n774,FDR,四君子汤,四君子汤 is used as a base treatment for FDr,9\r\n775,FDR,理中汤,理中汤 is used as a base treatment for FDr,9\r\n828,MRI,DWI,DWI is a mode of MRI that provides additional information for diagnosing ICH,9\r\n829,MRI,PWI,PWI is a mode of MRI that provides additional information for diagnosing ICH,9\r\n830,MRI,FLAIR,FLAIR is a mode of MRI that provides additional information for diagnosing ICH,9\r\n831,MRI,GRE,GRE is a mode of MRI that provides additional information for diagnosing ICH,9\r\n832,MRI,SWI,SWI is a mode of MRI that is sensitive to early ICH and microbleeds,9\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
