It has a rising prevalence in China, affecting approximately 1.7% of males and 1.6% of females. Hypertension is a significant contributing factor to the development of atrial fibrillation, which in turn poses a major risk for stroke, systemic embolism, and cerebral embolism. The condition is closely linked to these serious complications, underscoring its clinical significance as both a standalone disorder and a risk factor for further cardiovascular events.\",14\n345,HYPERTENSION,\"**Hypertension** is a chronic medical condition and cardiovascular syndrome characterized by persistently elevated blood pressure, defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg in adults. In children aged 3–15, it is classified as blood pressure ≥P95, and for those aged 16–17, the threshold is ≥140/90 mmHg. Hypertension is further categorized into grades 1, 2, and 3 based on severity.  \n\nThe condition can be **primary (essential)** or **secondary**, with secondary hypertension often linked to underlying disorders such as kidney disease (e.g., ADPKD, renal parenchymal disease), primary aldosteronism (especially in resistant cases or with hypokalemia), connective tissue diseases, or renal artery stenosis. It is strongly influenced by **genetic and environmental factors** and is frequently comorbid with **obesity, diabetes, high lipid levels, atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS)**.  \n\nHypertension is a **major risk factor** for cardiovascular diseases, including **stroke, coronary heart disease, acute coronary syndrome, acute left heart failure, aortic dissection, and cognitive impairment**. It also increases the risk of **target organ damage** (heart, brain, kidneys, blood vessels) and **retinal changes**. In diabetic patients, it exacerbates cardiovascular complications.  \n\n**Management** involves lifestyle modifications (e.g., the **DASH diet**, CHH, and spicy dietary interventions) and pharmacological treatments, including **MRAs (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists), CCBs (calcium channel blockers), ACEIs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers), ARNIs (angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors), and newer agents like aprocitentan for resistant cases**. Procedures such as **renal denervation (RDN)** may also be considered.  \n\nHypertension is a **central focus** of clinical guidelines (e.g., **JNC7, ESC**) and is extensively studied in **telemonitoring programs and clinical trials**. Its treatment intensity and timing depend on **blood pressure levels and cardiovascular risk stratification**, requiring tailored follow-up intervals.  \n\nIn summary, hypertension is a **multifactorial, chronic condition** with significant systemic implications, necessitating comprehensive prevention, monitoring, and management strategies to mitigate its widespread cardiovascular and organ-related complications.\",183\n898,CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS,\"**Cardiovascular Events** are serious medical complications involving the heart and blood vessels, which include conditions such as heart attacks and strokes. These events are more likely to occur in individuals with underlying risk factors, particularly hypertension (high blood pressure), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and diabetes. Additional predictors of cardiovascular events include arterial stiffness, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), and the presence of atherosclerotic plaques. Elevated blood pressure levels further contribute to an increased risk of experiencing these adverse incidents. Overall, cardiovascular events represent a significant health concern for high-risk populations, emphasizing the importance of monitoring and managing contributing factors.\",9\n1654,AORTIC STENOSIS,,6\n1319,RENALDENERVATION,\"Renal denervation (RDN) is a procedure used to treat hypertension by disrupting renal sympathetic nerves to reduce blood pressure\"\"\",5\n1500,CHILDREN'S BLOOD PRESSURE,\"Diagnosis and assessment of children's blood pressure levels considering age, gender, and height factors\",4\n1883,ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE,\"Acute ischemic stroke is a condition where blood flow to the brain is blocked, often requiring careful blood pressure management to prevent further brain damage\",4\n909,LVH (LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY),\"Thickening of the heart's left ventricle, associated with uncontrolled hypertension\"\"\",3\n1015,ELDERLY PATIENTS,\"**Elderly Patients** are a demographic group aged 65 and above who require specialized blood pressure management due to age-related health considerations. They are more susceptible to hypertension and often need tailored strategies for effective blood pressure control. This group typically includes individuals aged 65–79 years, though the broader category encompasses all patients aged 65 and older. The management of their blood pressure must account for their unique physiological needs and potential comorbidities associated with aging.\",3\n1532,SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE,\"**Subarachnoid Hemorrhage** is a type of hemorrhagic stroke characterized by bleeding into the subarachnoid space, the area surrounding the brain. This condition can result from various causes, including severe hypertension.

While hypertension management in rheumatoid arthritis patients generally follows the same guidelines as the general population, particular emphasis is placed on lifestyle modifications and minimizing glucocorticoid use to reduce cardiovascular risks. The condition underscores the importance of comprehensive care to address both its inflammatory and cardiovascular implications.\",3\n977,CAROTID IMT,,2\n985,AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING (ABPM),\"**Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM)** is a diagnostic method primarily used to differentiate white coat hypertension from true hypertension, particularly in children.

characterized by interrupted or poor blood flow to the brain, resulting in cell death. It can be classified as **ischemic** (due to blocked blood vessels) or **hemorrhagic** (due to bleeding in the brain). Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a major risk factor for stroke, and controlling blood pressure through antihypertensive treatment is crucial for reducing both the risk of occurrence and recurrence.  \n\nStroke is also associated with other conditions, including **metabolic syndrome**, **high lipid levels**, **aortic stenosis** (due to altered cerebral hemodynamics), and **atrial fibrillation**, where anticoagulation therapies such as NOACs and warfarin are used to prevent stroke. Additionally, **folic acid therapy** (as demonstrated in the CSPPT trial) has been shown to help prevent stroke in certain populations.  \n\nBeyond its physiological causes, stroke is studied in relation to **depression** and is a leading cause of death, particularly in China, where it is the most common type of cardiovascular disease.

Furthermore, certain treatments, such as angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), have been found to be beneficial in managing aspects of Metabolic Syndrome. The combination of these factors underscores the importance of early diagnosis and comprehensive management to mitigate associated health risks.\",31\n1566,TARGET ORGAN PROTECTION,\"Target organ protection involves using medications like ACEI or ARB to prevent damage to kidneys, heart, and eyes in diabetic patients with hypertension.\"\"\",3\n1431,IMT,\"**IMT (Intima-Media Thickness)** is a measurement of the thickness of the carotid artery wall, specifically assessing the combined thickness of the intima and media layers. It serves as a key marker for **arterial stiffness**, **cardiovascular risk**, and the progression of **carotid atherosclerosis**. Additionally, IMT is recognized as an indicator of **asymptomatic target organ damage**, reflecting early vascular changes that may precede clinical symptoms. This measurement is widely used in cardiovascular research and clinical practice to evaluate vascular health and predict potential cardiovascular events.\",4\n1381,ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME,\"**ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME (ACS)** is a severe manifestation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) that encompasses life-threatening conditions such as heart attacks (myocardial infarctions) and unstable angina. It occurs when the blood supply to the heart is suddenly blocked, leading to an urgent medical situation. Rapid intervention, including blood pressure reduction, is often required to restore heart function and prevent further damage.
