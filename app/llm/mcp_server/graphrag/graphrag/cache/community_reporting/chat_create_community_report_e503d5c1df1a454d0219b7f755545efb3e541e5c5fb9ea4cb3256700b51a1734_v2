These medications work by inhibiting calcium ion influx into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac cells, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. CCBs are particularly effective in managing hypertension, including cases where patients have a history of myocardial infarction (heart attack).  \n\nWithin the CCB class, the dihydropyridine subclass is specifically noted for its efficacy in controlling hypertension. Additionally, CCBs are commonly prescribed as part of combination therapy for resistant hypertension, where other antihypertensive agents may not suffice.  \n\nBeyond their blood pressure-lowering effects, CCBs have minimal impact on lipid levels, making them a favorable option for patients with lipid metabolism concerns. Some CCBs also exhibit direct anti-atherosclerotic properties, contributing to their broader cardiovascular protective effects.  \n\nIn summary, CCBs are a versatile and widely used class of antihypertensive medications with applications in hypertension management, cardiovascular disease prevention, and combination therapy for treatment-resistant cases. Their favorable metabolic profile and additional anti-atherosclerotic benefits further enhance their clinical utility.\",10\r\n1198,RAS BLOCKER,\"RAS blockers are a class of medications used in the treatment of hypertension, often combined with other drugs for resistant cases\"\"\",2\r\n4455,FELODIPINE,\"**FELODIPINE** is a calcium channel blocker (CCB) primarily used for the management of hypertension. It works by relaxing blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure. However, its pharmacokinetics can be significantly affected by drug interactions, particularly with **itraconazole**, an antifungal medication. When co-administered with itraconazole, felodipine levels are drastically increased, leading to a heightened risk of hypotension due to excessive blood pressure reduction. This interaction underscores the importance of monitoring and potential dose adjustments when these drugs are used together.  \n\nIn summary, felodipine is an effective antihypertensive agent, but its therapeutic use requires caution in the presence of interacting medications like itraconazole to avoid adverse effects such as severe hypotension.\",2\r\n2068,RENIN ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM INHIBITOR (RASI),\"A class of drugs used to treat hypertension by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, particularly long-acting formulations.\"\"\",1\r\n4457,AMILODIPINE,,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n984,CCB,ACEI,\"**Summary of CCB and ACEI:**  \n\nCCB (Calcium Channel Blockers) and ACEI (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors) are two distinct classes of drugs primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure). Both are widely prescribed for managing cardiovascular conditions, though they function through different mechanisms.  \n\nCCBs work by inhibiting calcium entry into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac cells, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. ACEIs, on the other hand, block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, thereby lowering blood pressure and reducing strain on the heart.  \n\nWhile both drug classes share a primary indication for hypertension, they may also be used for other cardiovascular conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or kidney protection in diabetic patients. The descriptions provided emphasize their role in hypertension treatment, with one noting their broader application in cardiovascular care. There are no contradictions in the given descriptions—rather, they complement each other by reinforcing the primary use of CCBs and ACEIs while acknowledging their wider therapeutic potential.  \n\nIn summary, CCB and ACEI are essential antihypertensive medications with additional benefits in managing various cardiovascular disorders. Their mechanisms differ, but both contribute significantly to blood pressure control and overall cardiovascular health.\",21\r\n1000,RAS BLOCKER,CCB,RAS blockers and CCBs are often used together in combination therapy for resistant hypertension,12\r\n4586,CCB,FELODIPINE,Felodipine is a specific medication belonging to the CCB class,12\r\n1734,RENIN ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM INHIBITOR (RASI),CCB,Both are classes of antihypertensive drugs with different impacts on lipid metabolism,11\r\n4585,CCB,AMILODIPINE,Amilodipine is a specific medication belonging to the CCB class,11\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
