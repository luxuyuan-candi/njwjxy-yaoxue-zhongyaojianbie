This process increases the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks, strokes, and other complications. ASCVD is a major public health concern, particularly in China, where it is the leading cause of death among urban and rural residents, accounting for over 40% of fatalities.  \n\nASCVD risk is assessed through stratification methods, categorizing individuals as low, medium, or high risk based on factors like smoking, low HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), age, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. This risk assessment is used to guide clinical decisions, including lipid-lowering treatments such as statins, which are commonly prescribed for prevention and management. Additionally, ASCVD risk stratification helps determine target LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) levels, especially for patients with comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes.  \n\nManagement strategies for ASCVD include lifestyle interventions (e.g., diet, exercise) and medication to control cholesterol levels and other risk factors. Regular lipid monitoring is essential for both prevention and treatment. Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) is also a significant predictor of ASCVD events, further linking dyslipidemia and hypertension to disease progression.  \n\nWhile some descriptions refer to the condition as \"\"Arteriosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease,\"\" the more widely accepted term is **Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD)**, emphasizing the role of plaque buildup in arterial walls.

They are also monitored in diabetes management alongside other lipid parameters such as LDL-C and non-HDL-C.  \n\nTG elevation is often linked to an unhealthy lifestyle, including poor diet and lack of exercise, but can be managed through lifestyle modifications such as dietary control and increased physical activity. In some cases, medication, including statin drugs, may be prescribed to help reduce elevated triglyceride levels.  \n\nOverall, triglycerides play a significant role in evaluating metabolic disorders, cardiovascular risk, and diabetes-related complications, making them an important parameter in clinical diagnostics and preventive care.\",5\r\n2040,CHINESE GENERAL PRACTICE,\"Chinese General Practice is likely a medical organization or journal providing guidelines on lipid management and treatment\"\"\",2\r\n2062,IPE,\"IPE (Icosapent Ethyl) is a medication primarily used to manage elevated triglyceride levels in patients at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

IPE is specifically formulated to reduce triglycerides without significantly increasing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, making it a targeted therapeutic option for individuals with persistent hypertriglyceridemia despite statin therapy.  \n\nThe medication is derived from fish oil and contains no docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), distinguishing it from other omega-3-based treatments. Clinical studies have demonstrated that IPE not only lowers triglycerides but also reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in high-risk patients. Its mechanism of action involves modulating lipid metabolism, reducing inflammation, and improving endothelial function.  \n\nIPE is typically prescribed as an adjunct to diet and statin therapy in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥500 mg/dL) or as a secondary prevention measure in those with established cardiovascular disease or diabetes and additional risk factors.
