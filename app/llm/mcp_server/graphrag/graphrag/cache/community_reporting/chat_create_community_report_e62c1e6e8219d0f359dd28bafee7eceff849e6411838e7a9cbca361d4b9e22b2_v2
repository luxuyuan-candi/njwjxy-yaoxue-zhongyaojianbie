Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\r\n3187,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,\"**Atherosclerosis** is a chronic cardiovascular disease characterized by the progressive buildup of fatty deposits, cholesterol, and plaques within the arterial walls. This accumulation leads to the hardening and narrowing of arteries, reducing blood flow and increasing the risk of serious complications such as coronary heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes. The condition is primarily driven by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and other lipids in the blood, a state known as hyperlipidemia. However, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or \"\"good\"\" cholesterol, may help mitigate its progression.  \n\nThe disease develops when lipids, including cholesterol, accumulate in the artery walls, forming plaques that can restrict blood flow or rupture, triggering clot formation. Over time, these changes contribute to arterial stiffness and blockages, impairing oxygen and nutrient delivery to vital organs. Risk factors include high cholesterol, particularly elevated LDL levels, as well as other metabolic and lifestyle influences.  \n\nWhile the descriptions vary slightly in phrasing, they consistently emphasize atherosclerosis as a lipid-driven process that results in arterial plaque buildup, vascular narrowing, and heightened cardiovascular risk. The condition is both preventable and manageable through lifestyle modifications, lipid-lowering therapies, and monitoring of cholesterol levels.\",33\r\n3208,LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"**Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)** is a type of lipoprotein responsible for transporting cholesterol into surrounding tissues, including blood vessels. It accounts for approximately 75% of total cholesterol in the body. LDL plays a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of arterial plaques. When LDL levels are elevated, it deposits cholesterol in the walls of arteries, contributing to plaque formation and narrowing of the blood vessels. This process increases the risk of coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular complications. Due to its role in cholesterol transport and plaque accumulation, LDL is often referred to as \"\"bad cholesterol.\"\" Elevated LDL levels are strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, making it a critical biomarker in cardiovascular health assessments.\",10\r\n3209,HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"**High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)**, commonly referred to as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol, is a vital component of lipid metabolism with significant benefits for cardiovascular health. HDL accounts for approximately 25% of total cholesterol in the body and plays a crucial role in transporting excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver for processing and excretion, a process known as reverse cholesterol transport. This mechanism helps prevent the buildup of cholesterol in arterial walls, thereby reducing the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.  \n\nHDL is widely recognized for its protective effects on the cardiovascular system. Low levels of HDL are associated with a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, while elevated levels are linked to improved heart health. HDL also activates key enzymes involved in lipoprotein metabolism, further aiding in cholesterol clearance.  \n\nThe measurement of HDL levels is typically expressed in millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Lifestyle factors, such as regular exercise, can increase HDL concentrations, enhancing its cardioprotective benefits. Due to its role in reducing cardiovascular risk, maintaining healthy HDL levels is an important aspect of preventive healthcare.  \n\nIn summary, High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is a beneficial form of cholesterol that supports cardiovascular health by facilitating cholesterol removal, preventing arterial plaque formation, and lowering the risk of heart disease. Its levels can be improved through physical activity, underscoring the importance of lifestyle in maintaining optimal HDL function.\",10\r\n3489,ARTERIAL HARDENING,,6\r\n3497,FIBROUS CAP,The fibrous cap covers atherosclerotic plaques and its rupture can lead to thrombus formation,2\r\n3426,FOAM CELLS,\"Foam cells are lipid-laden macrophages that form during the development of atherosclerotic plaques.\"\"\",1\r\n3428,SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS,\"Smooth muscle cells in arterial walls can be stimulated by high lipid concentrations to release growth factors contributing to atherosclerosis\"\"\",1\r\n3429,MACROPHAGES,\"Macrophages in arterial walls can be stimulated by high lipid concentrations to release growth factors contributing to atherosclerosis\"\"\",1\r\n3430,PLATELETS,\"Platelets can be activated by high lipid concentrations, releasing growth factors that contribute to arterial wall thickening\"\"\",1\r\n3493,ARTERY,\"Arteries are blood vessels that can become narrowed or blocked by atherosclerotic plaques, leading to cardiovascular events\",1\r\n3495,BLOOD VESSEL,Blood vessels transport blood throughout the body and can develop atherosclerotic plaques,1\r\n3475,TAIWAN MAKAY,\"Taiwan Makay is an institution with experience in weight control, noting that weight loss can lead to reduced blood cholesterol levels>\",2\r\n3491,ASPIRIN,\"Aspirin is a medication used in cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment, often alongside statins\",2\r\n3268,ARTERIAL PLAQUE,,2\r\n3267,LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR,Lipoprotein receptors on cell surfaces interact with lipoproteins to regulate cholesterol metabolism>,2\r\n3486,CEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE,\"**Cerebral Hemorrhage**  \n\nCerebral hemorrhage, also known as intracerebral hemorrhage, occurs when weakened or damaged blood vessels in the brain rupture, leading to bleeding within the brain tissue. This condition is a severe and potentially life-threatening type of stroke, as the accumulated blood can increase pressure on the brain, causing damage to surrounding areas and impairing vital functions. It is closely linked to cardiovascular health, often arising from conditions such as hypertension (high blood pressure), aneurysms, or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which weaken blood vessel walls over time.  \n\nThe rupture of these vessels disrupts normal blood flow and oxygen supply to the brain, resulting in rapid neurological deterioration. Symptoms may include sudden severe headache, weakness or numbness in the face or limbs, difficulty speaking, loss of coordination, or altered consciousness. Immediate medical intervention is critical to minimize brain damage and improve survival outcomes.  \n\nAs a subtype of stroke, cerebral hemorrhage underscores the importance of managing cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption, to reduce the likelihood of such events. Treatment may involve surgical intervention, medication to control bleeding and pressure, and long-term rehabilitation to address neurological deficits.\",3\r\n3485,BRAIN INFARCTION,\"Brain infarction occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked, causing brain cell death and potentially leading to paralysis or speech impairment\",2\r\n3487,ANGINA PECTORIS,Angina pectoris is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle due to coronary artery narrowing,2\r\n3488,ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,\"Acute myocardial infarction occurs when blood flow to part of the heart is completely blocked, causing heart muscle death\",2\r\n3210,PLASMA,Plasma is the liquid component of blood where lipids are dispersed>,3\r\n3213,BLOOD CELLS,,1\r\n3496,THROMBUS,\"A thrombus is a blood clot that can form when atherosclerotic plaques rupture, leading to blockages in arteries\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2726,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,CHOLESTEROL,\"**ATHEROSCLEROSIS and CHOLESTEROL**  \n\nAtherosclerosis is a cardiovascular condition characterized by the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can lead to reduced blood flow and increased risk of heart disease and stroke. Cholesterol plays a critical role in this process, with its effects varying depending on the type.

In contrast, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or \"\"bad\"\" cholesterol, contributes to the development of atherosclerosis when present in excess. Elevated levels of LDL can lead to the accumulation of cholesterol in arterial walls, forming plaque and narrowing the arteries. Therefore, maintaining a balance between HDL and LDL cholesterol is essential in reducing the risk of atherosclerosis.
