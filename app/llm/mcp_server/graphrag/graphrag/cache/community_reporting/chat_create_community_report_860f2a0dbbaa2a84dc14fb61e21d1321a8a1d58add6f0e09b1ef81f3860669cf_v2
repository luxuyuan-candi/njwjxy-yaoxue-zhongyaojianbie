It is primarily used in combination with other pharmaceutical components to treat hypertension and related cardiovascular conditions. The drug has a long elimination half-life, ranging from 45 to 168 hours, and is typically administered in a daily dosage of 0.125 to 0.5 mg. While the provided descriptions do not pertain to entities such as organizations, people, geographic locations, or events, they collectively highlight 利血平's pharmacological properties, therapeutic applications, and its role in traditional and modern combination therapies for hypertension.  \n\nThe summary resolves any apparent contradictions by consolidating the drug's classification as both a centrally acting pharmaceutical agent and a traditional Chinese medicinal component, emphasizing its dual context in contemporary and historical medical practices.\",6\n1169,阿米洛利,**阿米洛利 (Amiloride)** 是一种保钾利尿剂，主要用于治疗高血压及相关病症。其消除半衰期为6-9小时，每日推荐剂量范围为5-10毫克。阿米洛利具有较弱的抗高血压活性，因此常与其他药物（如噻嗪类利尿剂）联合使用，以增强疗效并减少钾流失。此外，它也被用于治疗原发性醛固酮增多症。作为一种药物成分，阿米洛利在综合疗法中发挥重要作用，尤其适用于需要维持钾平衡的高血压患者。,4\n1253,可乐定,\"可乐定 is a pharmaceutical component and an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist used in combination with other drugs for treating hypertension and related conditions. It is commonly found in antihypertensive formulations due to its mechanism of action as an adrenergic agonist, which helps regulate blood pressure. The combined descriptions highlight its role as both a standalone therapeutic agent and a synergistic component in multi-drug treatments for hypertension.\",2\n1300,复方利血平,复方利血平 is a traditional Chinese antihypertensive combination drug,5\n1251,复方利血平氨苯蝶啶片,\"复方利血平氨苯蝶啶片 is a traditional Chinese antihypertensive combination drug used for treating hypertension. It contains multiple active ingredients, including Reserpine, Triamterene, Hydrochlorothiazide, and Dihydralazine, which work together to manage high blood pressure. The drug combines both traditional Chinese medicinal principles and modern pharmaceutical components to provide an effective treatment for hypertension.\",5\n1170,氨苯蝶啶,\"**氨苯蝶啶 (Triamterene)** is a pharmaceutical component primarily used as a potassium-sparing diuretic. It is often prescribed in combination with other drugs for the treatment of hypertension and related conditions. The medication has an elimination half-life of approximately 1.5–2 hours and is typically administered in a daily dosage range of 25–100 mg. While it was historically utilized to counteract potassium loss caused by other diuretics, its use has become less common in recent years due to the reduced risk of hypokalemia associated with low-dose thiazide diuretics. Despite this, it remains an option in specific clinical scenarios where potassium retention is a concern.\",3\n1252,珍菊降压片,\"**珍菊降压片** is a traditional Chinese antihypertensive combination drug used for treating hypertension. It contains active pharmaceutical ingredients such as **Clonidine** and **Hydrochlorothiazide**, blending traditional Chinese medicine principles with modern pharmacological components. This dual approach makes it an effective treatment for managing high blood pressure.\",4\n1249,双肼屈嗪,A pharmaceutical component used in combination with other drugs for treating hypertension and related conditions,1\n1250,异丙嗪,A pharmaceutical component used in combination with other drugs for treating hypertension and related conditions,1\n1165,吲达帕胺,\"**吲达帕胺 (Indapamide)** is a thiazide-like diuretic primarily used for the treatment of hypertension, particularly in China. It functions similarly to thiazide diuretics, promoting the excretion of water and electrolytes to lower blood pressure. The drug has an elimination half-life of approximately 18 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing. The typical daily dosage ranges from **1.25 to 2.5 mg per day**, ensuring effective management of hypertension while minimizing side effects. Indapamide's pharmacological profile and clinical utility make it a widely prescribed antihypertensive agent.\",4\n1164,氯噻酮,\"**氯噻酮 (Chlorthalidone)** is a thiazide-like diuretic primarily used for the treatment of hypertension. It functions similarly to thiazide diuretics but has a significantly longer elimination half-life of 35–50 hours, allowing for sustained therapeutic effects. The typical daily dosage ranges from 12.5 to 25 mg per day. Its prolonged action makes it a preferred choice for managing high blood pressure over standard thiazide diuretics.  \n\nThis summary combines both descriptions, clarifying that while it is structurally and functionally similar to thiazide diuretics, it is classified as \"\"thiazide-like\"\" due to its distinct pharmacokinetic properties. There are no contradictions in the provided descriptions—they complement each other by detailing its mechanism, half-life, dosage, and clinical use.\",3\n1269,噻嗪样利尿剂,Thiazide-like diuretics including indapamide and chlorthalidone have longer elimination half-lives than thiazide-type diuretics,3\n1268,噻嗪型利尿剂,Thiazide-type diuretics including hydrochlorothiazide and bendroflumethiazide are used for hypertension treatment,4\n1301,盐酸双肼屈嗪,盐酸双肼屈嗪 is a vasodilator component in traditional Chinese antihypertensive drugs,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1112,氢氯噻嗪,利血平,Combined in a single medication for treating hypertension,15\n1111,阿米洛利,氢氯噻嗪,Combined in a single medication for treating hypertension,13\n1113,氢氯噻嗪,可乐定,Combined in a single medication for treating hypertension,11\n1221,复方利血平,复方利血平氨苯蝶啶片,Both are traditional Chinese antihypertensive combination drugs,10\n1116,利血平,氨苯蝶啶,Combined in a single medication for treating hypertension,9\n1226,复方利血平氨苯蝶啶片,珍菊降压片,Both are traditional Chinese antihypertensive combination drugs,9\n1114,利血平,双肼屈嗪,Combined in a single medication for treating hypertension,7\n1115,利血平,异丙嗪,Combined in a single medication for treating hypertension,7\n1144,吲达帕胺,氯噻酮,Both are thiazide-like diuretics used for hypertension treatment,7\n1145,吲达帕胺,噻嗪样利尿剂,Indapamide is a representative drug of thiazide-like diuretics,7\n1149,噻嗪型利尿剂,噻嗪样利尿剂,Both are classes of diuretics used for hypertension treatment but with different pharmacological properties,7\n1146,氯噻酮,噻嗪样利尿剂,Chlorthalidone is a representative drug of thiazide-like diuretics,6\n1225,复方利血平,盐酸双肼屈嗪,复方利血平 contains 盐酸双肼屈嗪 as a component,6\n1230,珍菊降压片,可乐定,珍菊降压片 contains 可乐定 as a component,6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
