It functions by transporting cholesterol and other lipids from the bloodstream and peripheral tissues to the liver for breakdown and excretion, thereby helping to remove excess cholesterol and prevent its accumulation in arterial walls. This process reduces the risk of atherosclerosis (the buildup of plaque in arteries) and coronary heart disease, earning HDL its reputation as a \"\"scavenger\"\" in the vascular system.  \n\nElevated levels of HDL are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases, while reduced levels indicate an increased susceptibility to conditions such as coronary heart disease. Lifestyle factors such as smoking negatively correlate with HDL levels, whereas regular exercise, smoking cessation, and weight loss can help increase HDL concentrations.  \n\nAlthough HDL is primarily recognized as a beneficial lipid component, one description inaccurately refers to it as a \"\"drug for treating coronary heart disease.\"\" HDL itself is not a medication but a naturally occurring lipoprotein. However, therapies aimed at raising HDL levels or mimicking its functions are areas of research for improving cardiovascular health.  \n\nIn summary, 高密度脂蛋白 (HDL) is a protective lipoprotein that aids in cholesterol clearance, supports arterial health, and reduces the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Maintaining healthy HDL levels through lifestyle modifications remains a key strategy in cardiovascular disease prevention.\",13\r\n2299,长寿综合征,\"长寿综合征是指高密度脂蛋白水平显著升高的现象，与较低的冠心病发生率和较长寿命相关\"\"\",1\r\n2314,血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂,Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂) are drugs that do not affect HDL levels and are recommended for patients with isolated low HDL levels and hypertension.,1\r\n2315,长效钙拮抗剂,Long-acting calcium antagonists (长效钙拮抗剂) are drugs that do not affect HDL levels and are recommended for patients with isolated low HDL levels and hypertension.,1\r\n2313,烟酸,\"**烟酸（Nicotinic Acid）** 是一种水溶性维生素B3，同时也是一种烟酸类药物，主要用于调节血脂和治疗脂质代谢异常相关疾病。它具有广谱的调血脂作用，能够有效降低总胆固醇（TC）、甘油三酯（TG）、低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL-C）和极低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（VLDL-C）水平，同时提高高密度脂蛋白胆固醇（HDL-C）水平。  \n\n烟酸适用于多种血脂异常病症，包括轻至中度高胆固醇血症、混合型高脂血症、高三酰甘油血症，以及冠状动脉粥样硬化性心脏病（冠心病）伴低HDL水平的患者。其推荐剂量通常为**1-2克**（具体剂量可能因患者情况而异）。  \n\n作为药物，烟酸不仅具有调节血脂的功能，还因其维生素特性而参与体内代谢过程。其双重作用机制使其成为临床治疗血脂异常的重要选择之一。烟酸的药理作用明确，既能改善血脂谱，又对心血管疾病高危患者具有潜在益处。  \n\n综上，烟酸是一种兼具维生素和药物特性的复合分子，广泛应用于血脂异常及相关心血管疾病的治疗与管理。\",3\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1561,高密度脂蛋白,冠心病,高密度脂蛋白（HDL）与冠心病之间存在密切关联。多项研究表明，高密度脂蛋白水平过低或减少会显著增加患冠心病的风险，提示其可能是冠心病的重要预警指标之一。同时，高密度脂蛋白也被用于冠心病的治疗，且效果显著，这可能与其在脂质代谢和血管保护中的作用有关。因此，高密度脂蛋白不仅可作为冠心病风险的生物标志物，还可能成为治疗该疾病的有效手段之一。,40\r\n1686,高密度脂蛋白,长寿综合征,高密度脂蛋白水平升高与长寿综合征相关,14\r\n1720,高密度脂蛋白,血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂,Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors do not affect HDL levels and are recommended for patients with isolated low HDL levels and hypertension.,14\r\n1721,高密度脂蛋白,长效钙拮抗剂,Long-acting calcium antagonists do not affect HDL levels and are recommended for patients with isolated low HDL levels and hypertension.,14\r\n2003,烟酸,他汀类药物,烟酸和他汀类药物都是用于治疗高胆固醇血症的药物,11\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
