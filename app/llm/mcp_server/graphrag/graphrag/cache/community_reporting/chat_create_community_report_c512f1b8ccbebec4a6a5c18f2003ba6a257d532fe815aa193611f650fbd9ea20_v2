It is recognized as a potential adverse effect of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), particularly spironolactone, though this risk can be mitigated by the use of finerenone. Additionally, hyperkalemia serves as a contraindication for the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), as these medications may exacerbate elevated potassium levels. Thus, managing hyperkalemia is critical when prescribing MRAs, ARBs, or ACEIs to ensure patient safety.\",4\n1746,PRA,\"**PRA (Plasma Renin Activity)** is a clinical measurement used to assess the activity of the renin enzyme in the blood. It serves as a key diagnostic tool in evaluating conditions such as **aldosteronism**, where it helps determine the effectiveness of **mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) treatment** in patients. PRA provides insights into the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) by quantifying renin's enzymatic activity, aiding in the diagnosis and management of hypertension and related disorders. The test is particularly valuable in differentiating primary from secondary causes of hyperaldosteronism and guiding therapeutic decisions.  \n\n*(Note: Contradictions were not present in the provided descriptions, so the summary consolidates all details into a coherent overview.)*\",2\n1278,MRA,\"**Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists (MRA)** are a class of non-steroidal medications that act as selective antagonists of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), with high affinity and specificity for MR and low affinity for androgen, glucocorticoid, progesterone, and estrogen receptors, thereby minimizing adverse effects. MRAs are primarily used to treat **primary aldosteronism**, where they serve as a first-line therapy, as well as **heart failure** (particularly **HFrEF**), where they improve prognosis, reduce hospitalization rates, and lower mortality. Additionally, MRAs are employed in the management of **chronic kidney disease (CKD)** and **diabetic kidney disease**, where they help reduce proteinuria and slow disease progression.  \n\nMRAs are also utilized in **resistant hypertension**, often in combination with other antihypertensive agents, to effectively lower blood pressure. However, their use may be associated with side effects such as **hyperkalemia** (especially in CKD patients), **male gynecomastia**, and **sexual dysfunction**. Newer MRAs, such as **finerenone**, have been developed specifically for treating diabetic kidney disease, offering targeted therapeutic benefits.  \n\nOverall, MRAs are versatile medications with significant clinical applications in cardiovascular, renal, and endocrine disorders, though careful monitoring is required to mitigate potential adverse effects.\",21\n1284,SPIRONOLACTONE,\"**Spironolactone** is a steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) and aldosterone receptor antagonist primarily used in the treatment of hypertension, particularly in cases of drug-resistant or resistant hypertension, such as in diabetic patients when other treatments fail. It is also effective in managing conditions related to aldosterone excess. Additionally, spironolactone may improve obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) severity and blood pressure. While it serves as a fourth-line treatment for hypertension, its use can be limited by intolerable side effects, prompting the consideration of alternatives like eplerenone. Overall, spironolactone is a versatile medication with applications in hypertension management and potential benefits for OSAS.\",9\n1285,EPLERENONE,\"**EPLERENONE** is an aldosterone receptor antagonist primarily used for the treatment of hypertension. It is a steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) that is metabolized by the enzyme CYP3A4. Eplerenone serves as an alternative to spironolactone, particularly for patients who cannot tolerate the latter due to adverse effects. Beyond its use in hypertension, eplerenone has been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Its selective action on aldosterone receptors contributes to its efficacy and tolerability profile.\",4\n1286,FINERENONE,\"**Finerenone** is a third-generation, non-steroidal, selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) with antifibrotic activity. It is characterized by its balanced tissue distribution between the heart and kidneys, which contributes to improved safety in hyperkalemia compared to older MRAs like spironolactone. Finerenone is approved for cardiorenal protection in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD), specifically for the treatment of diabetic kidney disease. Its unique pharmacological profile makes it a valuable therapeutic option for reducing fibrosis and protecting both cardiac and renal function in this high-risk patient population.\",6\n2858,PATHWAY-2 TRIAL,A randomized trial comparing spironolactone with other treatments for resistant hypertension,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1129,ARB,HYPERKALEMIA,\"Hyperkalemia is a risk when using ARB, especially in CKD patients\",52\n1985,原发性醛固酮增多症,PRA,Suppressed PRA is a diagnostic feature of primary aldosteronism,32\n1176,MRA,SPIRONOLACTONE,Spironolactone is a type of MRA used for hypertension and heart failure.,30\n1183,SPIRONOLACTONE,EPLERENONE,\"SPIRONOLACTONE and EPLERENONE are both mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and aldosterone receptor antagonists used in the treatment of hypertension.
