FEES provides a direct visualization of pharyngeal and laryngeal movements during swallowing, offering real-time insights into swallowing mechanics. It is considered a cost-effective alternative to Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS), another common diagnostic tool for dysphagia. FEES is widely recognized for its utility in evaluating swallowing disorders, enabling clinicians to identify abnormalities and tailor appropriate interventions. By combining endoscopic imaging with functional assessment, FEES serves as a reliable and efficient diagnostic approach in both clinical and research settings.\",2\r\n3682,PEG,\"Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) is an effective method for long-term enteral nutrition (>4 weeks) in patients with severe dysphagia, reducing complications compared to nasogastric tubes\",3\r\n3680,VFSS,\"The **Video Fluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS)** is widely recognized as the gold standard for evaluating swallowing function. It is a diagnostic procedure used to assess key aspects of swallowing, including **penetration** (when food or liquid enters the airway but does not pass below the vocal folds), **aspiration** (when material enters the airway below the vocal folds), and **residue** (remaining material in the pharynx after swallowing). While the VFSS is a critical tool for assessing swallowing disorders in general, it is particularly emphasized as the gold standard for evaluating swallowing function in **stroke patients**, who often experience dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) as a result of neurological impairment. The procedure utilizes real-time X-ray imaging (fluoroscopy) to visualize the swallowing mechanism, providing clinicians with detailed insights to guide treatment and management strategies.  \n\nBy combining these descriptions, it is clear that the VFSS serves as the most reliable method for diagnosing swallowing impairments across various patient populations, with a strong emphasis on its role in stroke-related dysphagia assessment. The summary remains consistent, as both descriptions reinforce the VFSS's status as the gold standard while highlighting its broader applicability alongside its specific importance for stroke patients.\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3088,FEES,PEG,\"PEG is a long-term nutritional solution for patients with severe dysphagia, while FEES is a diagnostic tool for assessing swallowing function\",5\r\n3089,PEG,吞咽障碍患者,Patients with swallowing disorders may require PEG for long-term enteral nutrition (Ⅱ级推荐，B级证据),5\r\n3086,VFSS,FEES,\"**VFSS and FEES: Comprehensive Summary of Swallowing Function Evaluation Methods**  \n\nVFSS (Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study) and FEES (Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing) are both objective, clinically validated methods used to assess swallowing function, particularly in stroke patients and individuals with suspected dysphagia. These techniques are widely recommended for further evaluation in patients who exhibit positive results on initial screening tests, such as the water swallow test, with strong supporting evidence (Ⅰ级推荐, A级证据).  \n\nVFSS, often considered the gold standard, utilizes real-time X-ray imaging to visualize the swallowing mechanism, providing detailed insights into bolus movement and structural abnormalities. FEES, on the other hand, employs a flexible endoscope to directly observe pharyngeal and laryngeal structures during swallowing, offering a viable alternative to VFSS in cases where radiation exposure is a concern or when bedside assessment is preferred. While both methods serve the same primary purpose—evaluating swallowing safety and efficiency—they differ in their approach, advantages, and limitations.  \n\nFEES is particularly useful for detecting residue, aspiration, and pharyngeal motility issues without radiation, making it suitable for repeated assessments. VFSS, however, provides a dynamic view of the entire swallowing process, including the oral and esophageal phases, which FEES cannot fully capture. Despite these differences, both are endorsed as reliable diagnostic tools, with the choice between them often depending on clinical context, patient-specific factors, and resource availability.  \n\nIn summary, VFSS and FEES are complementary, evidence-based methods for swallowing evaluation, each with distinct strengths. Their combined use or selective application ensures comprehensive assessment and tailored management for patients with dysphagia.\",4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
