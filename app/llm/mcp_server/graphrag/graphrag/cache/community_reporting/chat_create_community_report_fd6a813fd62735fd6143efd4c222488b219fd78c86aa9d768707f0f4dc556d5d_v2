It has the largest elderly population in the world, accounting for one-fifth of the global elderly demographic, and this group often experiences multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy. Cardiovascular diseases, including heart disease and stroke, are major health concerns, with heart disease ranking as the third leading cause of death in urban areas. Studies on stroke epidemiology, prevention, and management strategies have been conducted, reflecting the growing burden of these conditions.  \n\nThe incidence of atherosclerosis is rising, with onset occurring at younger ages, while hyperlipidemia rates are increasing, particularly in northern cities. Hypertension is another critical issue, driven by risk factors such as high sodium intake and obesity. Overall, CVD rates are climbing significantly, especially among middle-aged and elderly populations.  \n\nTo address these challenges, China is actively working to improve its primary healthcare system, focusing on better management of hypertension and dyslipidemia. The country also serves as the operational base for journals and pharmaceutical networks involved in these health initiatives.  \n\nIn summary, China’s healthcare landscape is marked by an aging population, rising CVD prevalence, and efforts to strengthen preventive and treatment measures through systemic improvements.\",17\r\n3338,SWEDEN,\"Sweden is a country where significant medical and health-related research has been conducted. Notably, Karlsson carried out research in Sweden focusing on exercise and its effects on lipoprotein levels. Additionally, Sweden serves as the location for the analysis of prescription drug registry data, specifically for patients aged 75 and older. These studies highlight Sweden's role in advancing healthcare research, particularly in areas related to aging, medication use, and the physiological impacts of exercise. The country's robust data systems and research infrastructure enable such comprehensive analyses, contributing to broader scientific and medical knowledge.\",2\r\n734,HONG KONG,\"Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China known for its dense urban population and advanced healthcare system. A significant percentage of its elderly population takes multiple medications, reflecting both the aging demographic and the prevalence of chronic conditions requiring long-term treatment. Additionally, Hong Kong has been referenced in discussions surrounding the definition of minor ailments, likely in the context of healthcare policies, pharmacy practices, or public health guidelines. This suggests that the region has a structured approach to managing both chronic and minor health issues, balancing the needs of its aging population with broader healthcare efficiency.
