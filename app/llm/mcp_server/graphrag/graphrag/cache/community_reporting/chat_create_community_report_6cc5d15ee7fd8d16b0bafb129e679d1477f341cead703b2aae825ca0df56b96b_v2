These institutions play a pivotal role in preventive care and long-term health management, particularly for conditions such as hypertension and dyslipidemia (abnormal blood lipid levels).  \n\nA key responsibility of 社区卫生服务机构 is the formation of general practitioner teams tasked with comprehensive community health initiatives. These teams conduct screenings, diagnoses, and risk assessments for coexisting hypertension and dyslipidemia, identifying critical conditions and providing pre-hospital emergency care when necessary. Additionally, they implement stratified management and regular follow-ups to monitor patient progress.  \n\nFurthermore, 社区卫生服务机构 oversee the coordinated care of patients with coexisting hypertension and dyslipidemia, facilitating bidirectional referrals (between primary and specialized care) and ensuring continuity through systematic follow-up management. By integrating screening, risk evaluation, emergency response, and ongoing patient supervision, these institutions enhance community health outcomes and reduce the burden on higher-level healthcare facilities.  \n\nIn summary, 社区卫生服务机构 serve as essential hubs for public health, chronic disease management, and community-based care, with a focus on early detection, risk mitigation, and sustained patient support.
