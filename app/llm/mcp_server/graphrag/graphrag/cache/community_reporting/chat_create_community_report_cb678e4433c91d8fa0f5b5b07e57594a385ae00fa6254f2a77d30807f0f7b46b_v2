It is involved in the breakdown of various pharmaceuticals, including repaglinide, and its activity can be influenced by inhibitors and inducers. Inhibition of CYP2C8 can substantially slow down the metabolism of certain drugs, potentially leading to altered drug efficacy or toxicity. The enzyme is recognized for its involvement in the metabolism of multiple medications, underscoring its importance in pharmacokinetics.  \n\nThe descriptions highlight CYP2C8's function across different contexts, emphasizing its role in drug processing and the impact of its modulation. While one description notes its involvement in the metabolism of repaglinide specifically, another broadly states its participation in the metabolism of various drugs. These statements are complementary, as CYP2C8 is known to metabolize a range of compounds beyond repaglinide. The mention of inhibitors and inducers further reinforces its clinical relevance, as these modulators can affect drug interactions and therapeutic outcomes.  \n\nThe inclusion of a Chinese description (\"\"CYP2C8是一种代谢酶，参与多种药物的代谢\"\") aligns with the other statements, confirming CYP2C8's role in metabolizing multiple drugs without introducing contradictions.  \n\nIn summary, **CYP2C8** is a key drug-metabolizing enzyme with broad substrate specificity, capable of processing medications such as repaglinide. Its activity can be altered by inhibitors or inducers, impacting drug metabolism rates. This enzyme is critical in pharmacology due to its influence on drug interactions and therapeutic effects.\",5\r\n3275,罗格列酮,罗格列酮是一种药物，主要经CYP2C8代谢,3\r\n3276,吡格列酮,吡格列酮是一种药物，主要经CYP2C8代谢,3\r\n3267,沙格列汀,\"沙格列汀（沙格列汀）是一种口服降糖药，属于二肽基肽酶-4（DPP-4）抑制剂类药物。其主要通过细胞色素P450酶系统中的CYP3A4/5亚型代谢。由于这一代谢途径的特性，沙格列汀与CYP3A4/5强抑制剂（如酮康唑、克拉霉素等）或强诱导剂（如利福平、卡马西平等）合用时，可能显著影响其血药浓度。具体而言，CYP3A4/5强抑制剂可能升高沙格列汀的血药浓度，增加不良反应风险；而强诱导剂则可能降低其血药浓度，导致疗效减弱。因此，临床使用中需注意药物相互作用，必要时调整剂量或选择替代治疗方案。  \n\n该药物通过抑制DPP-4酶延缓胰高血糖素样肽-1（GLP-1）的降解，从而增强胰岛素分泌并降低血糖水平，适用于2型糖尿病患者的血糖控制。其代谢依赖性和潜在的药物相互作用是临床用药时需重点考量的因素。\",4\r\n3270,CYP3A4/5强抑制剂,,1\r\n3408,CYP3A4/5,\"CYP3A4/5 is a metabolic enzyme involved in drug metabolism, with strong and moderate inhibitors listed\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1712,吉非罗齐,高脂血症,吉非罗齐用于治疗以三酰甘油升高为主的高脂血症。,122\r\n2698,吉非罗齐,西立伐他汀,吉非罗齐与西立伐他汀联用有致横纹肌溶解的报道,13\r\n2640,瑞格列奈,氯吡格雷,\"瑞格列奈与氯吡格雷合用时存在显著的药物相互作用风险。氯吡格雷可能显著提高瑞格列奈的血药浓度，从而增加低血糖的发生概率。这一相互作用机制表明，两者联合使用需谨慎，并密切监测血糖水平以避免不良反应。  \n\n综合现有信息，瑞格列奈（一种快速作用的胰岛素促泌剂）与氯吡格雷（一种抗血小板药物）的联用可能导致协同效应，进一步加剧低血糖风险。因此，临床使用时应评估患者个体情况，必要时调整剂量或采取预防措施。\",12\r\n2823,CYP2C8,瑞格列奈,瑞格列奈 is metabolized by CYP2C8,9\r\n2647,罗格列酮,CYP2C8,罗格列酮主要经CYP2C8代谢,8\r\n2648,吡格列酮,CYP2C8,吡格列酮主要经CYP2C8代谢,8\r\n2641,沙格列汀,CYP3A4/5强抑制剂,沙格列汀与CYP3A4/5强抑制剂合用可能显著升高其血药浓度,5\r\n2815,CYP3A4/5,沙格列汀,沙格列汀 is metabolized by CYP3A4/5,5\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
