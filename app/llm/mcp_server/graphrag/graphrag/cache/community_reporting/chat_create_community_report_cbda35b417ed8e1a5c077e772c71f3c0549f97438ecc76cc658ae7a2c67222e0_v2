The practice is widely recommended by healthcare professionals due to its significant benefits in reducing the risk of smoking-related diseases, such as heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory conditions.  \n\nKey recommendations for smoking cessation include abstaining from tobacco use entirely and minimizing alcohol consumption, as excessive alcohol intake can negatively impact lipid levels and overall metabolic health. Additionally, avoiding secondhand smoke is emphasized, as passive exposure to tobacco smoke can still pose serious health risks.  \n\nBy quitting smoking, individuals can achieve better lipid profiles, lower blood pressure, and improved circulation, contributing to long-term health benefits. The combination of smoking cessation and reduced alcohol intake further enhances these positive outcomes, supporting a healthier lifestyle.  \n\nIn summary, smoking cessation is a critical health intervention that involves quitting tobacco use, limiting alcohol, and avoiding secondhand smoke to promote better lipid management and overall well-being.\",2\r\n1173,PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS,\"Healthcare facilities where patients with severe mental health conditions, such as severe depression, are referred for specialized treatment\"\"\",1\r\n1177,BMI CONTROL,\"Recommendation to maintain BMI below 24kg/m² for hypertension control\"\"\",2\r\n1178,WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE,\"**WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE** is a key health metric used to assess abdominal obesity and associated health risks. According to recommendations, men should aim to maintain a waist circumference below **90 cm**, while women should keep theirs below **85 cm**. These thresholds are based on evidence linking excessive abdominal fat to increased risks of metabolic and cardiovascular conditions.  \n\nAdditionally, waist circumference is highlighted as a useful measure for managing **blood pressure and cholesterol levels**, as abdominal obesity is closely associated with hypertension and dyslipidemia. Monitoring and maintaining a healthy waist circumference can thus serve as a preventive strategy for reducing the likelihood of these conditions.  \n\nIn summary, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE is an important indicator of health, with specific gender-based targets (90 cm for men, 85 cm for women) to mitigate risks related to cardiovascular and metabolic health, including blood pressure and cholesterol management.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n969,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE PATIENTS,DOCTORS,Doctors provide medical advice and treatment plans to high blood pressure patients,8\r\n971,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE PATIENTS,MEDICATION THERAPY,High blood pressure patients may require medication therapy to control their blood pressure,7\r\n972,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE PATIENTS,SMOKING CESSATION,Patients are advised to quit smoking,7\r\n974,DOCTORS,PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS,Doctors refer patients with severe mental health conditions to professional medical institutions,4\r\n981,BMI CONTROL,WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE,Both are anthropometric measures for hypertension control,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
