These drugs are particularly recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes who are at high cardiovascular risk or have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), as they offer significant cardiorenal protection and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.  \n\nIn addition to glycemic control, GLP-1RA has demonstrated benefits in improving metabolic syndrome outcomes, including blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients with diabetes or obesity. The medication is recognized for its antihypertensive effects, as well as its role in providing comprehensive cardiovascular and renal protection.  \n\nOverall, GLP-1RA serves as a multifunctional therapeutic option, addressing not only diabetes and obesity but also contributing to improved cardiovascular and renal health in high-risk patients.\",9\n1348,SGLT2I,\"**Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors (SGLT2i)** are a newer class of medications primarily used to treat **type 2 diabetes**, but they also offer **broad cardiorenal and metabolic benefits**. These drugs, which include **dapagliflozin and empagliflozin**, help lower blood glucose levels by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the kidneys. Beyond glycemic control, SGLT2i has demonstrated **cardioprotective and renoprotective effects**, making them beneficial for patients with **chronic kidney disease (CKD)**—even in those without diabetes—as well as for individuals with **heart failure, particularly HFrEF (heart failure with reduced ejection fraction)**.  \n\nSGLT2i is **recommended for CKD patients with an eGFR ≥20 mL/(min·1.73m²)** and has been shown to **reduce hospitalization rates, mortality, and improve prognosis in heart failure patients**. Additionally, these medications contribute to **blood pressure reduction** and play a role in **managing metabolic syndrome**, offering a **comprehensive approach** to treating interrelated conditions. Their benefits extend to **cardiovascular risk reduction**, reinforcing their use in patients with **type 2 diabetes, CKD, or heart failure**.  \n\nIn summary, SGLT2i is a **versatile class of drugs** with **glycemic, cardiorenal, and metabolic advantages**, making them a **key therapeutic option** for multiple high-risk patient populations.\",14\n1353,EFFR,\"Estimated glomerular filtration rate, a measure of kidney function\"\"\",1\n1355,糖尿病肾病,\"Diabetic kidney disease, a complication of diabetes affecting kidney function\"\"\",1\n1352,HBA1C,\"Glycated hemoglobin, a measure of long-term blood glucose control\"\"\",1\n1344,血糖控制,血糖控制是高血压患者血糖管理的重要环节，目标包括糖化血红蛋白、空腹血糖和餐后血糖的控制,7\n1345,糖化血红蛋白,糖化血红蛋白是血糖控制的重要指标，目标值为<7%,1\n1346,空腹血糖,空腹血糖是血糖控制的重要指标，目标值为4.4~7.0 mmol/L,1\n1347,餐后2小时血糖,餐后2小时血糖是血糖控制的重要指标，目标值为<10.0 mmol/L,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1285,2型糖尿病,ASCVD,2型糖尿病是ASCVD的重要危险因素,53\n1278,高血压,心力衰竭,高血压是心力衰竭的重要危险因素,45\n1290,GLP-1RA,SGLT2I,Both are recommended for diabetes patients with specific complications,23\n1292,SGLT2I,EFFR,eGFR determines eligibility for SGLT2i use in kidney disease patients,15\n1293,SGLT2I,糖尿病肾病,SGLT2 inhibitors help slow progression of diabetic kidney disease,15\n1291,GLP-1RA,HBA1C,HbA1c levels influence the decision to use GLP-1RA in diabetes treatment,10\n1279,血糖控制,糖化血红蛋白,糖化血红蛋白是血糖控制的重要指标,8\n1280,血糖控制,空腹血糖,空腹血糖是血糖控制的重要指标,8\n1281,血糖控制,餐后2小时血糖,餐后2小时血糖是血糖控制的重要指标,8\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
