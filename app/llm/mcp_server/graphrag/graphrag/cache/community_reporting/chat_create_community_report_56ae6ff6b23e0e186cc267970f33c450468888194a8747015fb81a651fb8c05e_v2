It contains natural lovastatin and its analogs, along with other bioactive compounds, which contribute to its efficacy in managing hypercholesterolemia, particularly mild to moderate cases. As a statin-based drug, it reduces blood lipid levels and has been shown to lower the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile.  \n\nIn addition to its cholesterol-lowering effects, 血脂康 may assist in reducing blood sugar levels in diabetic patients, though its primary indication remains lipid regulation. It is classified as a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) preparation but shares pharmacological similarities with conventional statins due to its lovastatin content.  \n\nProduced domestically in China, 血脂康 is widely prescribed to modulate lipid metabolism and is recognized for its dual role as both a natural remedy and a clinically validated treatment for dyslipidemia. Its multi-component formulation distinguishes it from synthetic statins, offering a unique therapeutic profile within cardiovascular and metabolic care.  \n\n(Word count: 178)\",14\r\n3580,天然药物类,\"A class of natural lipid-lowering drugs with comprehensive effects\"\"\",1\r\n3882,中华心血管病学会,中华心血管病学会发布了《高脂血症防治建议》，为高脂血症的治疗提供了指导原则,6\r\n4561,红曲,红曲是血脂康的原料来源，从中提取天然洛伐他汀及其同系物,1\r\n3879,杂合子家族性高胆固醇血症,杂合子家族性高胆固醇血症是一种遗传性高胆固醇血症，需要强效降脂药物治疗。,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3206,普伐他汀,高脂血症,普伐他汀用于治疗高脂血症，降低血清低密度脂蛋白浓度。,243\r\n3207,洛伐他汀,高脂血症,洛伐他汀用于治疗高脂血症，降低胆固醇水平。,243\r\n3370,氟伐他汀,冠心病,氟伐他汀能降低胆固醇，从而预防冠心病,55\r\n4814,中国冠心病二级预防研究,中国,该研究是在中国进行的关于冠心病二级预防的研究,17\r\n3886,他汀类,贝特类,他汀类和贝特类是降脂药物的两大主要类别，具有不同的主要用途。他汀类药物主要用于降低低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL-C），而贝特类药物则侧重于降低甘油三酯（TG）并提高高密度脂蛋白胆固醇（HDL-C）。尽管两者的作用机制和侧重点不同，但在临床实践中，他汀类和贝特类药物可以联合使用，以更全面地调节血脂水平。然而，联合使用时需密切监测潜在的不良反应，例如肝功能异常、肌肉毒性（如横纹肌溶解症）以及胃肠道不适等。医生通常会根据患者的具体情况权衡利弊，调整剂量或选择替代方案以确保治疗的安全性和有效性。,16\r\n3490,血脂康,天然药物类,Xuezhikang belongs to the natural drug class,15\r\n3902,中华心血管病学会,洛伐他汀,中华心血管病学会推荐使用洛伐他汀等药物进行降脂治疗,15\r\n4812,血脂康,红曲,血脂康是从红曲中提取的中药制剂,15\r\n3888,他汀类,杂合子家族性高胆固醇血症,他汀类药物是治疗杂合子家族性高胆固醇血症的主要药物,10\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
