It affects the pharmacokinetics of various drugs, including simvastatin and dabigatran etexilate, by influencing their movement across cellular membranes. P-gp is primarily involved in the efflux of drugs, reducing their intracellular accumulation and impacting their bioavailability.  \n\nP-gp is inhibited by several substances, such as clarithromycin, cyclosporine (环孢素), and grapefruit juice (葡萄柚汁), which can alter the metabolism and efficacy of co-administered drugs. For example, grapefruit juice significantly inhibits P-gp activity, leading to increased drug absorption and potential toxicity.  \n\nWhile some descriptions emphasize P-gp's role in drug absorption and distribution, others highlight its involvement in excretion and metabolism. These functions are interconnected, as P-gp regulates drug transport across barriers like the intestinal epithelium, blood-brain barrier, and renal tubules, thereby affecting overall drug disposition.  \n\nIn summary, P-gp is a key drug transporter that modulates the pharmacokinetics of numerous medications through its effects on absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. Its inhibition by certain drugs and dietary components can lead to clinically significant drug interactions.\",17\r\n4893,利格列汀,利格列汀是一种药物，基本不经CYP450酶代谢，是P-gp的底物，与P-gp诱导剂合用时疗效会降低,2\r\n4894,维格列汀,维格列汀是一种药物，基本不经CYP450酶代谢，是P-gp的底物，与ACEI合用时可能增加血管神经性水肿的风险,2\r\n322,IL-1受体拮抗剂,\"IL-1受体拮抗剂可作为二线痛风急性发作期的治疗药物，适用于对一线药物不耐受或有禁忌的患者。\"\"\",2\r\n327,环孢素A,,1\r\n4961,维拉帕米,\"**维拉帕米（Verapamil）** 是一种药物，具有多种药理作用和药物相互作用。作为P-糖蛋白（P-gp）抑制剂，维拉帕米能够抑制P-gp介导的药物外排，从而增加某些药物的血药浓度。例如，它可以显著提高秋水仙碱（colchicine）和达比加群酯（dabigatran etexilate）的浓度，可能导致这些药物的毒性风险增加，如秋水仙碱中毒或达比加群相关的出血风险。  \n\n此外，维拉帕米与其他药物联用时可能产生协同或不良作用。与美托洛尔（metoprolol）合用时，两者对心脏传导系统和窦房结功能的抑制作用可能叠加，导致心动过缓、低血压等不良反应。同时，维拉帕米与辛伐他汀（simvastatin）联用时会抑制辛伐他汀的代谢，增加肌病（如肌肉疼痛、无力）和横纹肌溶解症的风险，因此需谨慎调整剂量或避免联合使用。  \n\n综上所述，维拉帕米在临床应用中需密切监测其与其他药物的相互作用，尤其是P-gp底物药物（如秋水仙碱、达比加群酯）以及经CYP3A4代谢的药物（如辛伐他汀），同时注意其对心血管系统的叠加效应（如与美托洛尔的联用）。合理用药可减少不良反应并确保治疗效果。\",5\r\n4876,阿卡波糖,\"阿卡波糖（Acarbose）是一种口服降糖药，属于α-糖苷酶抑制剂类降血糖药物。其原型药物在肠道内极少被吸收，主要通过抑制肠道内α-糖苷酶的活性，延缓碳水化合物的分解和葡萄糖的吸收，从而降低餐后血糖水平。  \n\n阿卡波糖的药代动力学特性显示，其原型药物在肠道内吸收极少，但约有35%的代谢产物可吸收入血。这一特性可能影响其与其他药物的相互作用，尤其是与地高辛和华法林等药物合用时需谨慎。有研究表明，阿卡波糖与地高辛合用可能降低地高辛的疗效，因此临床使用时需监测患者反应，必要时调整剂量。  \n\n总体而言，阿卡波糖是一种有效控制餐后高血糖的药物，但由于其独特的药代动力学特性和潜在的药物相互作用，在联合用药时需特别注意，以确保治疗的安全性和有效性。\",3\r\n4887,地高辛,,2\r\n5066,路优泰,路优泰是圣约翰草提取物的商品名，为CYP3A4和P-gp诱导剂,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n5267,克拉霉素,CYP3A4,克拉霉素抑制CYP3A4酶活性,69\r\n5407,CYP3A4,贯叶金丝桃,贯叶金丝桃含有CYP3A4诱导剂成分,63\r\n287,秋水仙碱,非甾体抗炎药,秋水仙碱和非甾体抗炎药均为痛风急性发作的一线治疗药物，可单独或联合使用。,23\r\n5135,西格列汀,P-GP,西格列汀是P-gp的底物,21\r\n5108,P-GP,OCT,Both P-gp and OCT are drug transporter proteins,19\r\n5138,利格列汀,P-GP,利格列汀是P-gp的底物,19\r\n5140,维格列汀,P-GP,维格列汀是P-gp的底物,19\r\n289,秋水仙碱,IL-1受体拮抗剂,IL-1受体拮抗剂可作为秋水仙碱不耐受或有禁忌时的二线治疗药物。,10\r\n290,秋水仙碱,环孢素A,环孢素A会抑制秋水仙碱的代谢，增加其毒性，因此使用环孢素A的患者禁用秋水仙碱。,9\r\n5227,美托洛尔,维拉帕米,维拉帕米与美托洛尔合用可能导致心动过缓和血压下降,9\r\n5127,阿卡波糖,地高辛,阿卡波糖与地高辛合用时可能存在药物相互作用，影响其疗效。研究表明，阿卡波糖可能减少地高辛的吸收，从而导致地高辛的疗效降低。因此，当这两种药物联合使用时，需密切监测地高辛的血药浓度及临床效果，必要时调整剂量以确保治疗效果。这一相互作用机制可能与阿卡波糖对肠道功能的调节作用有关，但其具体机制仍需进一步研究明确。,5\r\n5409,路优泰,贯叶金丝桃,路优泰是贯叶金丝桃提取物的商品名,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
