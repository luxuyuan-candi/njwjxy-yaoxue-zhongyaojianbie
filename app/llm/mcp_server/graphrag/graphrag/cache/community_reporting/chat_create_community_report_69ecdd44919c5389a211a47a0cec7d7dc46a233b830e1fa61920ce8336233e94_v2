Research indicates that **hypertension (elevated blood pressure)** is strongly associated with an increased risk of developing dementia and cognitive impairment.

Early diagnosis and standardized treatment are crucial to control symptoms and reduce relapse rates. Despite its prevalence, depression has low treatment rates, affecting 10% or fewer patients in many countries.
