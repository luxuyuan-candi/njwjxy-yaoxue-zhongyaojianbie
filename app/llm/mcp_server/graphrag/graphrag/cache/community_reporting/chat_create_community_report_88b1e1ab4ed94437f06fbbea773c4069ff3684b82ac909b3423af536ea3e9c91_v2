Clinical findings include active bowel sounds and the absence of abdominal tenderness or masses. It is classified under ICD-11 with the code **DD91.2**.  \n\n**Functional Dyspepsia (FDr)**, on the other hand, is a gastrointestinal disorder with an unclear etiology. Potential contributing factors include gastrointestinal motility abnormalities, heightened visceral sensitivity, intestinal flora imbalance, food allergies or intolerances, and psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, and depression.  \n\nWhile both conditions share the abbreviation \"\"FDr,\"\" they represent separate clinical entities with distinct diagnostic criteria and pathophysiological mechanisms. Functional Diarrhea primarily involves altered bowel habits without pain, whereas Functional Dyspepsia is associated with upper gastrointestinal symptoms and multifactorial causes. The term \"\"FDR\"\" should be clarified based on clinical context to avoid confusion between these two conditions.  \n\nThis summary reconciles the provided descriptions by distinguishing between the two disorders while acknowledging their shared medical and research framework.\",25\r\n1479,泄泻,,13\r\n1561,马贵同,\"马贵同是中医专家，强调泄泻与脾气虚弱、中阳不足、肠中湿热留滞有关，主张健脾补虚、温中清肠的治疗方法，常用四君子汤、理中汤等方剂。\"\"\",3\r\n1465,CT,\"**Computed Tomography (CT)** is a diagnostic imaging technique used to visualize internal organs and structures in the human body. It is widely employed in medical settings to diagnose a variety of conditions by generating detailed cross-sectional images of tissues, bones, and blood vessels. While CT scans are highly effective for many diagnostic purposes, they are less effective than Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in detecting chronic bleeding and cerebrovascular malformations. Despite this limitation, CT remains a valuable tool in clinical practice due to its speed, accessibility, and ability to provide clear images of complex anatomical structures.  \n\nIn summary, CT is a versatile medical imaging technique with broad diagnostic applications, though its effectiveness varies depending on the clinical context, particularly when compared to MRI for certain neurological conditions.\",2\r\n1587,八段锦,八段锦（Baduanjin）是一种中国传统健身运动，被推荐作为高血压患者（FDr患者）的适宜体育活动之一。该运动结合舒缓的动作、呼吸调节和身心放松，具有缓解压力、调整情绪的作用。研究表明，规律练习八段锦（每周3至5次，每次30分钟）有助于降低血压、改善血脂水平，同时对心血管健康产生积极影响。作为低强度有氧运动，八段锦适合不同年龄段和健康状况的人群，尤其适合慢性病患者作为日常康复锻炼的一部分。其传统养生理念与现代医学建议相结合，体现了中西医协同的健康管理方式。,2\r\n1590,三阴交,\"**三阴交 (Sanyinjiao, SP6)** is an acupuncture point utilized in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), situated on the spleen meridian. It is also referenced in acupressure practices, particularly for home massage therapy as part of FDr (Fascial Distortion Model) treatment. In TCM, this point is commonly employed to regulate the spleen, liver, and kidney meridians, addressing conditions such as digestive disorders, gynecological issues, and fatigue. Its dual application in both acupuncture and acupressure highlights its therapeutic versatility, though its primary classification remains rooted in classical TCM as a key point on the spleen channel.  \n\nThe point is located on the inner lower leg, approximately three finger-widths above the medial malleolus (inner ankle bone), making it accessible for self-massage or professional needling. While its role in FDr treatment emphasizes manual pressure for fascial and musculoskeletal corrections, its TCM applications focus more on balancing qi and blood flow. Despite differing therapeutic frameworks, both descriptions agree on its anatomical position and its significance in holistic and alternative medicine practices.  \n\nIn summary, **三阴交** serves as a multifunctional point, integral to both traditional acupuncture and modern acupressure techniques, with its usage adapted to varying treatment modalities while retaining its foundational importance in TCM.\",2\r\n1462,ICD-11,\"The International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11), is a global standard for diagnostic health information.\"\"\",1\r\n1463,X线钡灌肠,\"X-ray barium enema is a diagnostic procedure used to examine the colon and rectum for abnormalities such as tumors, polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease.\"\"\",1\r\n1464,肠镜,\"Colonoscopy is a diagnostic procedure used to examine the colon and rectum for abnormalities such as tumors, polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease.\"\"\",1\r\n1466,PET,\"Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a diagnostic imaging technique used to visualize metabolic processes in the body.\"\"\",1\r\n1566,四君子汤,\"A traditional Chinese medicine formula used as a base treatment for FDr, often combined with other symptoms for辨证加减 (syndrome differentiation and modification).\"\"\",1\r\n1567,理中汤,\"Another traditional Chinese medicine formula used as a base treatment for FDr, often combined with other symptoms for辨证加减 (syndrome differentiation and modification).\"\"\",1\r\n1568,艾灸,\"A traditional Chinese medicine therapy involving moxibustion at specific acupuncture points like Shenque, Qihai, Tianshu, Guanyuan, and Zusanli to treat FDr.\"\"\",1\r\n1569,针刺,\"A traditional Chinese medicine therapy involving acupuncture at points like Zhongwan, Tianshu, Guanyuan, and Zusanli, adjusted based on patient's syndrome differentiation.\"\"\",1\r\n1570,穴位贴敷,\"A traditional Chinese medicine therapy involving herbal patches applied to acupuncture points, such as using modified antidiarrheal powder for spleen-stomach deficiency FDr.\"\"\",1\r\n1595,中医药循证医学,,1\r\n1586,五禽戏,\"A traditional Chinese exercise similar to Tai Chi, mentioned as part of the recommended physical activities for FDr patients.\"\"\",1\r\n1589,导引术,\"A traditional Chinese exercise therapy mentioned as part of the recommended physical activities.\"\"\",1\r\n1592,太白,\"An acupressure point mentioned for home massage therapy in FDr treatment.\"\"\",1\r\n1594,神阙穴,\"An acupressure point mentioned for home massage therapy in FDr treatment.\"\"\",1\r\n1467,下利,\"An alternative TCM term for diarrhea, classified under FDr's symptom-based naming convention.\"\"\",1\r\n1468,鹜溏,\"A TCM term for diarrhea with undigested food particles, classified under FDr's symptom-based naming.\"\"\",1\r\n1469,飧泄,\"A TCM term for morning diarrhea, classified under FDr's symptom-based naming.\"\"\",1\r\n1470,脾泄,\"TCM classification of FDr when attributed to spleen dysfunction.\"\"\",1\r\n1471,胃泄,\"TCM classification of FDr when attributed to stomach dysfunction.\"\"\",1\r\n1472,大肠泄,\"TCM classification of FDr when attributed to large intestine dysfunction.\"\"\",1\r\n1473,肝泄,\"TCM classification of FDr when attributed to liver dysfunction.\"\"\",1\r\n1474,肾泄,\"TCM classification of FDr when attributed to kidney dysfunction.\"\"\",1\r\n1475,暑泄,\"TCM classification of FDr when caused by summerheat pathogens.\"\"\",1\r\n1476,湿泻,\"TCM classification of FDr when caused by dampness pathogens.\"\"\",1\r\n1477,伤食泻,\"TCM classification of FDr when caused by dietary irregularities.\"\"\",1\r\n1478,寒泄,\"TCM classification of FDr when caused by cold pathogens.\"\"\",1\r\n1147,MRI,\"**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** is a diagnostic medical imaging technique used to visualize internal organs and structures in detail. It is particularly valuable for examining soft tissues, making it a critical tool in diagnosing a variety of conditions. MRI is employed in the assessment of **primary aldosteronism** and **pheochromocytoma complications** in hypertensive patients, aiding in the identification of adrenal gland abnormalities. Additionally, it is highly effective in detecting **chronic bleeding** and **cerebrovascular malformations**, providing detailed insights into vascular and neurological disorders.  \n\nAs a non-invasive imaging modality, MRI utilizes magnetic fields and radio waves to generate high-resolution images, offering superior contrast between different tissues compared to other techniques like CT scans. Its versatility makes it indispensable in neurology, cardiology, oncology, and musculoskeletal imaging. By combining anatomical and functional information, MRI supports accurate diagnosis and treatment planning across multiple medical specialties.  \n\nIn summary, MRI serves as a comprehensive imaging solution for both structural and functional evaluation, with applications ranging from endocrine disorders (e.g., adrenal tumors) to cerebrovascular and neurological conditions. Its precision and safety (lacking ionizing radiation) reinforce its widespread use in modern medicine.\",8\r\n1785,DWI,\"Diffusion Weighted Imaging is a mode of MRI that measures the diffusion of water molecules in tissues, providing additional information for diagnosing ICH>\",1\r\n1786,PWI,\"Perfusion Weighted Imaging is a mode of MRI that measures blood flow in tissues, providing additional information for diagnosing ICH>\",1\r\n1787,FLAIR,\"Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery is a mode of MRI that suppresses the signal from fluids to better visualize other tissues, providing additional information for diagnosing ICH>\",1\r\n1788,GRE,\"Gradient Echo Sequence is a mode of MRI that is sensitive to magnetic field inhomogeneities, providing additional information for diagnosing ICH>\",1\r\n1789,SWI,Susceptibility Weighted Imaging is a mode of MRI that is sensitive to early ICH and microbleeds>,1\r\n1591,足三里,\"**足三里 (Zusanli, ST36)** is a significant acupressure and acupuncture point in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). It is commonly used in both home massage therapy and clinical acupuncture for its therapeutic benefits. As the lower he-sea point of the stomach meridian (胃的下合穴), it is particularly effective in treating abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal disorders.  \n\nIn clinical practice, 足三里 is frequently stimulated through acupuncture to alleviate abdominal discomfort and improve digestive function. Additionally, it is recommended for self-care practices, such as acupressure, as part of home-based therapies like FDr (Functional Diarrhea Relief) treatment.  \n\nThe point’s dual application—both in professional acupuncture and self-administered massage—highlights its versatility in TCM. While descriptions may vary slightly in emphasis (clinical vs. home use), they consistently affirm its role in addressing abdominal pain and related conditions. Thus, 足三里 serves as a key therapeutic point in both professional and personal healthcare within traditional Chinese medicine.\",7\r\n4305,天枢,\"An acupuncture point used in traditional Chinese medicine, located on the stomach meridian\"\"\",2\r\n4315,中脘,\"An acupuncture point used in traditional Chinese medicine, located on the conception vessel meridian\"\"\",2\r\n1537,余绍源,\"余绍源教授是一位现代中医领域的知名专家，尤其在功能性腹泻（FDr）的治疗方面具有深厚的学术造诣和丰富的临床经验。他提出了“脾胃虚弱、水湿不运是FDr的关键病机”这一重要学术观点，强调脾胃功能失调在疾病发生发展中的核心作用，并特别注重顾护脾阴的临床实践。  \n\n在治疗上，余绍源擅长运用苍术等药物调理脾胃、缓解泄泻症状，同时结合岭南地区的地理与气候特点，因地制宜地使用当地中草药，体现了其灵活辨证的诊疗思路。他的功能性腹泻治疗经验已被系统总结，为中医临床提供了宝贵的参考。  \n\n综合来看，余绍源教授将传统中医理论与地域特色相结合，形成了独特的学术体系，对推动中医脾胃病诊疗的发展作出了显著贡献。\",5\r\n1560,蔡淦,\"蔡淦是一位中医专家，专注于慢性泄泻的治疗与研究。他认为慢性泄泻的病机以脾虚清阳不升为本，同时可兼有肝郁、肾虚、湿胜等证型。在治疗上，他提出以健脾升清为核心的治疗原则，并擅长运用经典方剂如痛泻要方、四神丸等进行辨证施治。蔡淦的临床经验与学术观点在相关领域得到认可，其关于慢性泄泻的治疗方法也被专门介绍，体现了他在这一领域的专业贡献。  \n\n通过整合上述描述，蔡淦的学术特色可总结为：以中医理论为基础，强调脾虚在慢性泄泻发病中的关键作用，同时兼顾肝、肾、湿等影响因素，形成了一套以健脾升清为主、兼顾疏肝、温肾、化湿的综合治疗体系。他的经验方剂应用和临床思路为慢性泄泻的中医诊疗提供了重要参考。\",3\r\n4297,叶天士,\"叶天士，清代著名中医学家，是传统中医（TCM）历史上的重要代表人物之一。他的医学贡献主要体现在理论著述与临床实践两方面：其著作《临证指南医案》（\"\"Clinical Guide Medical Cases\"\"）系统总结了其丰富的诊疗经验，成为后世研习中医的重要文献；同时，他提出的“久病入络”理论（\"\"chronic diseases entering collaterals\"\"）深刻阐释了慢性疾病的病理机制，对中医络病学的发展影响深远。  \n\n在临床诊疗方面，叶天士对腹痛病症的辨治具有独到见解。他认为腹痛的病位可分为脏腑两类：病变在脏者（如肝、脾、肾功能失调）多由内在脏腑虚损或气机阻滞引发；而在腑者（如胃、肠等）则以胃部病变为首要因素。治疗上，他强调以“通”法为核心，通过调和气血、疏通经络来恢复脏腑功能，这一原则既体现了中医“通则不痛”的理论基础，也展现了其注重辨证施治的学术特色。  \n\n综上，叶天士的医学成就既包含系统的理论创新，又涵盖实用的临床经验，其思想至今仍对中医理论与实践具有指导意义。\",7\r\n4303,桃红四物汤,桃红四物汤是一种中药方剂，用于治疗久病在血的腹痛，常用桃红四物汤加减，酌加薤白通阳散结，桂枝温经通络,1\r\n4304,《临证指南医案》,《临证指南医案》是叶天士的医学著作，其中记载了治疗腹痛的“通”法理论,1\r\n4378,临证指南医案·腹痛,A medical case compilation by Ye Tianshi focusing on abdominal pain diagnosis and treatment,1\r\n4379,久病入络,Ye Tianshi's academic theory about chronic diseases affecting the collaterals,1\r\n1562,岭南,\"A geographical region in China referenced for its distinctive herbal medicine practices and local population's health characteristics\"\"\",4\r\n1563,五爪龙,\"A type of Lingnan (Southern China) herbal medicine frequently used in treatments described\"\"\",1\r\n1564,救必应,\"A medicinal herb native to Lingnan region used in the described treatments\"\"\",1\r\n1565,火炭母,\"A Lingnan herbal medicine mentioned in the therapeutic approaches\"\"\",1\r\n4306,关元,\"An acupuncture point used in traditional Chinese medicine, located on the conception vessel meridian\"\"\",3\r\n4362,席婷,\"席婷 is a co-author of an analysis of Ye Tianshi's \"\"Clinical Guide Medical Cases · Abdominal Pain\"\"\",3\r\n4363,柴少竹,\"柴少竹 is a co-author of an analysis of Ye Tianshi's \"\"Clinical Guide Medical Cases · Abdominal Pain\"\"\",2\r\n4364,淡丽娟,\"淡丽娟 is a co-author of an analysis of Ye Tianshi's \"\"Clinical Guide Medical Cases · Abdominal Pain\"\"\",2\r\n4313,气海,\"An acupuncture point used in traditional Chinese medicine, located on the conception vessel meridian\"\"\",1\r\n4314,内关,\"An acupuncture point used in traditional Chinese medicine, located on the pericardium meridian\"\"\",2\r\n1593,太冲,\"**太冲 (Taichong)** is an acupuncture point used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), situated on the liver meridian.
