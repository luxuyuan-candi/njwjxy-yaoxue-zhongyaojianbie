At higher doses than those required for its vitamin effects, niacin demonstrates significant lipid-regulating properties, making it a therapeutic option for managing high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It is considered an alternative to statins for specific patient groups, particularly those who may not tolerate statin therapy well.  \n\nThe drug class includes extended-release niacin tablets and related compounds like acipimox, both of which are used to reduce lipid levels. Its efficacy and optimal dosage depend on the patient's baseline lipid profile, with adjustments made to achieve desired therapeutic outcomes.  \n\nIn addition to its lipid-lowering effects, niacin can enhance the vasodilatory properties of antihypertensive medications, potentially leading to a drop in blood pressure. This interaction underscores the importance of careful monitoring when niacin is used alongside other cardiovascular drugs.  \n\nOverall, niacin functions as a versatile agent in managing dyslipidemia, offering benefits for patients who require alternative or adjunctive lipid-modifying therapy while necessitating attention to potential hemodynamic effects.\",5\r\n2571,INOSITOL NICOTINATE,\"Inositol Nicotinate is an ester formed by one molecule of inositol and six molecules of niacin.
