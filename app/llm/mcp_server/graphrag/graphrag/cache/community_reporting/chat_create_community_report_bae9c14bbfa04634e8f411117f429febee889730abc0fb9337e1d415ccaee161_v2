Elevated TG levels (≥1.7 mmol/L) are a diagnostic criterion for dyslipidemia and are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), even when low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is well-controlled. TG elevation is often linked to an unhealthy lifestyle, including poor diet and lack of exercise, but can also be influenced by genetic factors.  \n\nTG is monitored alongside other lipid parameters, such as LDL-C and non-HDL-C, particularly in diabetes management, as it contributes to residual cardiovascular risk. While lifestyle modifications—such as improved diet and regular exercise—are primary strategies for managing high TG levels, medications like statins may also be prescribed to reduce elevated triglycerides.  \n\nIn summary, TG is a critical lipid parameter used in dyslipidemia diagnosis, ASCVD risk assessment, and metabolic health evaluation. Its elevation signals potential cardiovascular risk, necessitating lifestyle changes and, in some cases, pharmacological intervention for optimal management.\",15\r\n3191,他汀革命,\"“他汀革命”是指他汀类药物在防治冠心病及其他心血管疾病方面取得的重大进展，尤其在21世纪产生了深远影响。这一革命性进展主要体现在他汀类药物通过降低胆固醇水平，显著减少了心血管疾病的发病率和死亡率，成为现代医学防治动脉粥样硬化性心血管疾病（ASCVD）的重要里程碑。  \n\n“他汀革命”不仅改变了冠心病的治疗策略，还推动了全球范围内对血脂管理的重视。他汀类药物通过抑制胆固醇合成关键酶（HMG-CoA还原酶），有效降低低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL-C），从而减少动脉粥样硬化斑块的形成，降低心肌梗死、脑卒中等心血管事件的风险。  \n\n这一概念强调了从单纯治疗转向预防的医学模式转变，并因其广泛的临床证据和显著疗效，被公认为心血管疾病防治领域的重大突破。\",2\r\n3029,OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS,\"**OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS** are a class of polyunsaturated fats that include compounds such as IPE (icosapent ethyl), EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid).
