Elevated TG levels (â¥1.7 mmol/L) are a diagnostic criterion for dyslipidemia and are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), even when low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is well-controlled. TG elevation is often linked to an unhealthy lifestyle, including poor diet and lack of exercise, but can also be influenced by genetic factors.  \n\nTG is monitored alongside other lipid parameters, such as LDL-C and non-HDL-C, particularly in diabetes management, as it contributes to residual cardiovascular risk. While lifestyle modificationsâsuch as improved diet and regular exerciseâare primary strategies for managing high TG levels, medications like statins may also be prescribed to reduce elevated triglycerides.  \n\nIn summary, TG is a critical lipid parameter used in dyslipidemia diagnosis, ASCVD risk assessment, and metabolic health evaluation.

The compound's dual role in lipid modulation and ASCVD risk reduction underscores its importance in cardiovascular health.\",4\r\n3008,çº¢æ²ä¸ä¸­è¯å¤åå¶å,ä¸ç§çº¢æ²ä¸ä¸­è¯ï¼å±±æ¥ãæ³½æ³»ãç½æ¯ï¼çå¤åå¶åï¼å·æéä½èåºéçä½ç¨,6\r\n3005,è´ç¹ç±»è¯ç©,\"**è´ç¹ç±»è¯ç©ï¼Fibratesï¼**æ¯ä¸ç±»ä¸»è¦ç¨äºéä½çæ²¹ä¸é¯ï¼TGï¼æ°´å¹³çè¯ç©ï¼å¸¸ç¨äºæ²»çé«çæ²¹ä¸é¯è¡çãå¶ä¸»è¦ä½ç¨æºå¶æ¯éè¿æ¿æ´»è¿æ°§åç©é¶ä½å¢æ®ç©æ¿æ´»åä½ï¼PPAR-Î±ï¼ï¼ä»èè°èèè´¨ä»£è°¢ï¼åå°èèä¸­çæ²¹ä¸é¯çåæå¹¶ä¿è¿å¶æ¸é¤ã  \n\nå¸¸è§çè´ç¹ç±»è¯ç©åæ¬éè¯ºè´ç¹çãå¾®ç²åéè¯ºè´ç¹ãéè¯ºè´ç¹ç¼éè¶åãè¯æè´ç¹ãè¯æè´ç¹ç¼éçä»¥ååéè´é½ãè¿äºè¯ç©å¨åååè¯ä»£å¨åå­¦ä¸ææä¸åï¼ä¾å¦ç¼éå¶åå¯å»¶é¿è¯ç©ä½ç¨æ¶é´ï¼åå°ç»è¯é¢çã  \n\nå°½ç®¡è´ç¹ç±»è¯ç©å¨éçæ²¹ä¸é¯æ¹é¢æææ¾èï¼ä½å¨æ¢æ§è¾èçï¼CKDï¼æ£èä¸­éè°¨æä½¿ç¨ï¼éå¸¸éè¦è°æ´åéä»¥é¿åè¯ç©èç§¯åæ½å¨çä¸è¯ååºãå æ­¤ï¼ä¸´åºä½¿ç¨æ¶åºç»åæ£èè¾åè½æåµå¶å®ä¸ªä½åæ²»çæ¹æ¡ã  \n\næ»çæ¥è¯´ï¼è´ç¹ç±»è¯ç©æ¯æ²»çé«çæ²¹ä¸é¯è¡ççéè¦éæ©ï¼ä½å¨ç¹æ®äººç¾¤ï¼å¦CKDæ£èï¼ä¸­éå¯åçæµä»¥ç¡®ä¿å®å¨æ§åæææ§ã\",13\r\n3006,Î©-3èèªé¸,\"**Î©-3èèªé¸ï¼Omega-3 Fatty Acidsï¼** æ¯ä¸ç±»ç¨äºè¾å©æ²»ççæ²¹ä¸é¯ï¼TGï¼ç®¡ççå¤ä¸é¥±åèèªé¸ï¼ä¸»è¦ä½ä¸ºéçæ²¹ä¸é¯è¯ç©ä½¿ç¨ãå¶å¤æ¹çº§å¶åï¼å¦IPEï¼äºåç¢³äºç¯é¸ä¹é¯ï¼åEPAï¼äºåç¢³äºç¯é¸ï¼+DHAï¼äºåäºç¢³å­ç¯é¸ï¼çç»åï¼éè¿å¤ç§æºå¶éä½è¡æ¶²ä¸­çTGæ°´å¹³ãè¿äºæºå¶åæ¬æå¶æä½å¯åº¦èèç½èåºéï¼VLDL-Cï¼ççæãä¿è¿VLDL-Cçæ¸é¤ï¼ä»¥åæ¿æ´»èç½èèªé¶ï¼LPLï¼çæ´»æ§ï¼ä»èå éTGçä»£è°¢ã  \n\nÎ©-3èèªé¸å¨ä¸´åºä¸­å¹¿æ³åºç¨äºé«çæ²¹ä¸é¯è¡ççæ²»çï¼å°¤å¶éç¨äºéè¦è¯ç©å¹²é¢çæ£èãå¶çæåå®å¨æ§å·²å¾å°éªè¯ï¼å¯ä½ä¸ºåä¸çæ³æä¸å¶ä»éèè¯ç©èåä½¿ç¨ãä¸åå¶åï¼å¦çº¯EPAæEPA+DHAç»åï¼å¯è½å·æç¥å¾®ä¸åçä½ç¨æºå¶åéåºçï¼ä½æ ¸å¿ç®æ åä¸ºéä½TGæ°´å¹³ï¼æ¹åå¿è¡ç®¡é£é©ã  \n\nç»¼ä¸ï¼Î©-3èèªé¸æ¯ä¸ç±»éè¦çéèè¯ç©ï¼éè¿å¤éå¾è°èèè´¨ä»£è°¢ï¼ä¸ºé«çæ²¹ä¸é¯æ£èæä¾ææçæ²»çéæ©ã\",6\r\n3445,ééç´ ,ééç´ ï¼Penicillinï¼æ¯ä¸ç§åå²ä¸æä¸ºéè¦çè¯ç©ï¼å¶åç°å¯¹äººç±»å»å­¦è´¡ç®å·¨å¤§ãæä¸­å°ä»æ±ç±»è¯ç©ä¸ééç´ è¿è¡æ¯è¾ï¼å¸æ¾äºééç´ å¨å»å­¦å²ä¸çéç¨ç¢æä¹ãåæ¶ï¼ééç´ çè´¡ç®è¢«ç±»æ¯äºéèæ²»çå¨å å¿çé²æ²»ä¸­çä½ç¨ï¼è¿ä¸æ­¥å¼ºè°äºå¶å¨ç¾çæ²»çåå¬å±å«çé¢åçæ·±è¿å½±åãééç´ çå¹¿æ³åºç¨ä¸ä»å¼åäºæçç´ æ¶ä»£ï¼è¿ä¸ºåç»­è¯ç©ç ååç¾çé²æ²»æä¾äºéè¦åé´ã,1\r\n3881,ç¯å­¢èç´ ,ç¯å­¢èç´ æ¯ä¸ç§ç¨äºæ²»çé«èåºéè¡ççè¯ç©,1\r\n4095,å®°éµææ¦éµå­,\"An influential international clinical study demonstrating statins' effectiveness in stroke reduction\"\"\",1\r\n4096,æ¦ç²¤ç ¸è,\"A major clinical research study proving statins' ability to decrease stroke occurrence\"\"\",1\r\n4099,æºæ,,1\r\n3847,èé¸è¯åå,èé¸è¯ååæ¯ä¸ç±»ç¨äºè°èè¡èçè¯ç©ï¼ä¸»è¦ç¨äºæ²»çä¸¥éçæé¾æ²»æ§é«èåºéè¡çãå¶ä½ç¨æºå¶æ¯éè¿é»æ­¢èé¸æèåºéå¨è éçå¸æ¶ï¼ä¿è¿å¶éç²ªä¾¿æåºä½å¤ï¼ä»èå éèåºéçéè§£ãè¿ç±»è¯ç©éè¿åå°è éå¯¹èé¸åèåºéçéå¸æ¶ï¼é´æ¥éä½è¡æ¶²ä¸­çèåºéæ°´å¹³ï¼å°¤å¶éç¨äºéè¦é¿ææ§å¶è¡èçæ£èãèé¸è¯ååå¨ä¸´åºåºç¨ä¸­å¸¸ä½ä¸ºè¾å©æ²»çææ®µï¼å°¤å¶å¯¹äºå¶ä»éèè¯ç©ææä¸ä½³çæ£èå·æéè¦ä»·å¼ã,11\r\n3851,æ··ååé«èè¡ç,\"æ··ååé«èè¡çæ¯æè¡æ¸æ»èåºéä¸ä¸é°çæ²¹é½åé«çè¡èå¼å¸¸\"\"\",7\r\n3028,FIBRATES,\"**FIBRATES** are a class of drugs primarily used to lower triglyceride levels in the blood. This group includes medications such as fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, and clofibrate. In addition to their primary role in reducing triglycerides, fibrates also modestly increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, often referred to as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol.  \n\nThe mechanism of action of fibrates involves multiple pathways. They inhibit adenylate cyclase, reduce the release of fatty acids, and enhance the activity of lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that breaks down very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglycerides. These actions collectively lead to reductions in VLDL, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels.  \n\nWhile fibrates are most effective in managing hypertriglyceridemia, their impact on HDL cholesterol provides additional cardiovascular benefits. However, their influence on LDL cholesterol is less pronounced compared to other lipid-lowering agents like statins. Overall, fibrates are a well-established therapeutic option for patients with elevated triglyceride levels and mixed dyslipidemia.\",10\r\n3587,èæ¥ç¯èº,\"èæ¥ç¯èºï¼åç§°æ¶èèºï¼æ¯ä¸ç§èæ±é¸è¯ååï¼å±äºæ èç±»è¯ç©ï¼ä¸»è¦ç¨äºæ²»çåçº¯é«èåºéè¡çãå¶ä½ç¨æºå¶æ¯éè¿ä¸è éåçèæ±é¸ç»åï¼é»æ­èæ±é¸çè èå¾ªç¯ï¼ä»èä¿è¿èåºéä»£è°¢ï¼è¾¾å°éä½è¡æ¶²ä¸­èåºéæ°´å¹³çææã  \n\nèæ¥ç¯èºçå¸¸è§åéèå´ä¸ºæ¯æ¬¡æºï½ç¼åï¼å·ä½åéééµå»å±è°æ´ï¼ãä¸´åºä½¿ç¨æ¶éæ³¨æï¼è¯¥è¯ä¸æäºè¯ç©ï¼å¦é¿å¡æ³¢ç³ï¼åç¨æ¶å¯è½éä½çæï¼å æ­¤åºé¿ååæ¶æç¨æå¨å»çæå¯¼ä¸è°æ´ç¨è¯æ¹æ¡ã  \n\nç»¼ååæè¿°ï¼èæ¥ç¯èºçæ ¸å¿åè½æ¯ä½ä¸ºéèè¯ï¼éç¨äºé«èåºéè¡çæ£èï¼ä½éæ³¨ææ½å¨çè¯ç©ç¸äºä½ç¨ä»¥ç¡®ä¿æ²»çææã\",5\r\n3017,éè¯ºè´ç¹ç,è´ç¹ç±»è¯ç©ï¼åéä¸º0.1 gï¼3æ¬¡/d,1\r\n3018,å¾®ç²åéè¯ºè´ç¹,è´ç¹ç±»è¯ç©ï¼åéä¸º0.2 gï¼1æ¬¡/d,1\r\n3019,éè¯ºè´ç¹ç¼éè¶å,è´ç¹ç±»è¯ç©ï¼åéä¸º0.25 gï¼1æ¬¡/d,1\r\n3021,è¯æè´ç¹ç¼éç,è´ç¹ç±»è¯ç©ï¼åéä¸º0.4 gï¼1æ¬¡/d,1\r\n3850,çº¯åå­å®¶ææ§é«èåºéè¡ç,\"çº¯åå­å®¶ææ§é«èåºéè¡çæ¯ä¸ç§ç¹æ®ç±»åçé«èåºéè¡ç\"\"\",2\r\n3848,å°ç»´ç¯èº,\"å°ç»´ç¯èºæ¯ä¸ç§èé¸è¯ååï¼å±äºæ èç±»ï¼ç¨äºæ²»çé«èåºéè¡ç\"\"\",1\r\n3855,PROBUCOL,\"**Probucol**, also known as *Bifenabid*, is an orally administered antioxidant drug with lipid-regulating properties.
