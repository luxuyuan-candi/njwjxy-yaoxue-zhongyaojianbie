It is closely associated with a range of comorbidities, particularly hyperlipidemia (high blood lipids), hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. The condition frequently presents with dyslipidemia, including elevated triglycerides, abnormal apolipoprotein levels, and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, all of which contribute to an increased risk of atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and other cardiovascular complications.  \n\nDiabetes and hyperlipidemia share common pathophysiological mechanisms, often coexisting as part of a metabolic syndrome linked to modern lifestyle factors. Studies indicate that diabetes doubles the risk of comorbid depression and significantly elevates the likelihood of developing fatty liver disease. Additionally, individuals over 30 with diabetes face a substantially higher risk of coronary artery disease.  \n\nManagement of diabetes requires targeted treatment, including specialized lipid-lowering medications when hyperlipidemia is present. Physical activity plays a preventive role by improving glucose and lipid metabolism, stabilizing insulin levels, and reducing diabetes risk by up to 20% in active individuals compared to sedentary populations. Poorly controlled diabetes exacerbates lipid abnormalities, further increasing cardiovascular risks.  \n\nIn summary, diabetes is a major modifiable risk factor for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases, with strong correlations to hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and other metabolic disorders. Effective management involves addressing both glycemic control and associated lipid abnormalities to mitigate long-term complications.\",25\r\n3816,慢跑,慢跑是一种中等强度的有氧运动，适合包括健康人群、糖尿病病人以及高脂血症患者在内的多种人群。作为一种中小强度的运动方式，慢跑有助于改善代谢和健康，尤其对糖尿病患者具有积极的健康效益。同时，对于高脂血症患者，每天坚持慢跑3-5千米可以有效降低血脂水平。因此，慢跑是一种广泛适用的运动选择，能够为不同健康状况的人群提供心血管和代谢方面的益处。,2\r\n3817,游泳,\"游泳是一种中小强度的有氧运动，适合糖尿病病人和高脂血症病人选择，有助于改善心肺功能和代谢。\"\"\",2\r\n3819,自行车,\"自行车是一种中小强度的有氧运动，适合糖尿病病人作为运动选择，有助于改善糖代谢和脂质代谢。\"\"\",2\r\n1170,视网膜病变,,1\r\n1169,肾小球滤过率,A measure of kidney function,1\r\n3815,散步,\"散步是一种中小强度的有氧运动，适合糖尿病病人作为运动选择，有助于稳定血糖和胰岛素水平。\"\"\",1\r\n3818,爬山,\"爬山是一种中小强度的有氧运动，适合糖尿病病人作为运动选择，有助于增强体能和代谢。\"\"\",1\r\n3202,降脂药,\"降脂药是用于治疗高脂血症的药物，包括他汀类等\"\"\",4\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3788,糖尿病,慢跑,慢跑适合糖尿病病人作为运动选择，有助于改善代谢,27\r\n3789,糖尿病,游泳,游泳适合糖尿病病人作为运动选择，有助于改善糖代谢,27\r\n3791,糖尿病,自行车,自行车适合糖尿病病人作为运动选择，有助于改善糖代谢,27\r\n965,糖尿病,视网膜病变,Retinopathy is a common complication of diabetes,26\r\n967,糖尿病,肾小球滤过率,Diabetic nephropathy affects glomerular filtration rate,26\r\n3787,糖尿病,散步,散步适合糖尿病病人作为运动选择，有助于稳定血糖,26\r\n3790,糖尿病,爬山,爬山适合糖尿病病人作为运动选择，有助于增强代谢,26\r\n2746,降脂药,他汀类药,他汀类药是降脂药的一种,7\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
