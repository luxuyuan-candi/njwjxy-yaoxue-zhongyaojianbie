It is one of the most significant drug-metabolizing enzymes in the human body, influencing the efficacy and safety of numerous medications.  \n\nCYP3A4 is involved in the breakdown of certain statins, and its activity can be inhibited by calcium channel blockers like amlodipine, as well as by grapefruit juice, which can alter the metabolism of drugs that depend on this enzyme. Conversely, the induction of CYP3A4 (e.g., by certain medications or substances) can lead to reduced drug efficacy or increased fluctuations in blood pressure due to accelerated drug clearance.  \n\nWhile CYP3A4 primarily metabolizes many drugs, including some beta-blockers and sedative-hypnotics, it also contributes to the metabolism of R-warfarin, though other enzymes (such as CYP2C9) are more dominant in warfarin metabolism. The descriptions collectively emphasize CYP3A4's broad substrate specificity and its clinical significance in drug interactions, particularly with inhibitors like grapefruit juice or inducers that modulate its activity.  \n\nIn summary, CYP3A4 is a versatile enzyme central to drug metabolism, with implications for therapeutic outcomes, drug interactions, and individualized medication management.\",30\r\n3307,CLARITHROMYCIN,Clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,2\r\n3308,ERYTHROMYCIN,Erythromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,2\r\n3265,那格列奈,\"那格列奈（Nateglinide）是一种口服降糖药，属于格列奈类药物。其主要通过细胞色素P450酶系统中的CYP2C9和CYP3A4代谢。作为一种速效胰岛素促泌剂，那格列奈通过刺激胰腺β细胞释放胰岛素来帮助控制血糖水平，尤其适用于2型糖尿病患者的餐后血糖管理。  \n\n两种描述均明确指出那格列奈的代谢途径依赖CYP2C9和CYP3A4酶，且其药理分类为格列奈类降糖药。尽管表述语言不同（中英文），但核心信息一致，无矛盾。综合来看，那格列奈的作用机制和代谢特性使其成为糖尿病治疗中针对餐后高血糖的针对性药物，但需注意与其他通过相同酶代谢的药物可能存在的相互作用。\",2\r\n3279,卡格列净,卡格列净是一种药物，仅有7%经CYP3A4代谢,1\r\n3301,BISOPROLOL,Bisoprolol is a beta-blocker metabolized by CYP3A4,1\r\n3303,ATORVASTATIN,Atorvastatin is a lipophilic statin metabolized by CYP3A4,1\r\n632,KETOCONAZOLE,\"Ketoconazole is an over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections\"\"\",1\r\n3305,POSACONAZOLE,Posaconazole is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n3306,VORICONAZOLE,Voriconazole is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n3309,TELITHROMYCIN,Telithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n3310,AMIODARONE,Amiodarone is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n3311,AMLODIPINE,Amlodipine is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n3312,VERAPAMIL,Verapamil is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n3339,利伐沙班,\"Rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2J2, with increased bleeding risk when combined with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors\"\"\",1\r\n219,秋水仙碱,\"秋水仙碱（Colchicine）是一种口服药物，主要用于预防和治疗痛风。在预防方面，它通常以小剂量（0.5 mg）使用，特别是在患者开始降尿酸治疗的初期阶段，以减少痛风发作的风险。在治疗方面，秋水仙碱对痛风急性发作有效，但建议在症状出现后12小时内开始使用，超过36小时后其疗效可能显著下降。  \n\n使用秋水仙碱时需根据患者的肾功能调整剂量，以避免潜在的毒性反应。常见的不良反应包括胃肠道症状（如恶心、呕吐、腹泻），长期或过量使用可能导致肝、肾损害。因此，临床使用时需严格遵循剂量指导，并监测患者的肝肾功能。  \n\n综合来看，秋水仙碱在痛风的管理中具有双重作用：既可作为急性发作期的治疗药物，也可作为降尿酸治疗初期的预防性用药，但需注意其不良反应和个体化用药原则。\",7\r\n220,非甾体抗炎药,\"**Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs, 非甾体抗炎药)** are a class of medications widely used for their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. They include common drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, aspirin, and celecoxib. NSAIDs serve as a first-line treatment for acute conditions like migraines, musculoskeletal pain, and gout attacks.  \n\nIn the context of **gout**, NSAIDs are frequently prescribed when colchicine is contraindicated or ineffective. They are particularly useful for managing acute gout flare-ups, with both non-selective COX inhibitors (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) and selective COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) being commonly employed. However, their use requires caution due to potential **gastrointestinal risks** (e.g., ulcers, bleeding) and **cardiovascular risks** (e.g., increased blood pressure, heart attack risk), especially with long-term or high-dose use.  \n\nFor **acute pain management**, NSAIDs are often the preferred choice due to their rapid onset of action and effectiveness in reducing inflammation. Drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen, and diclofenac are frequently used to alleviate pain from conditions such as headaches, sprains, and arthritis.  \n\nIn summary, NSAIDs (非甾体抗炎药) are versatile medications essential for treating acute pain, inflammation, and gout, but their use must be carefully monitored to mitigate adverse effects, particularly in patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal or cardiovascular conditions.\",11\r\n221,糖皮质激素,\"糖皮质激素主要用于急性痛风发作伴全身症状或其他药物无效时，推荐短期使用，需注意高血压等副作用。\"\"\",2\r\n229,双氯芬酸,\"**双氯芬酸 (Diclofenac)** is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to treat pain and inflammatory conditions. It functions as a non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, effectively reducing inflammation and alleviating pain. While some descriptions indicate it is available over-the-counter, its regulatory status may vary by region.  \n\nDiclofenac is commonly prescribed for acute pain management, with a typical dosage of 50 mg administered three times daily due to its relatively short half-life of approximately two hours. This pharmacokinetic profile makes it suitable for short-term use in conditions requiring rapid pain relief.  \n\nAs an NSAID, diclofenac shares therapeutic properties with other drugs in its class, such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects. However, its accessibility (prescription vs. over-the-counter) and specific dosing regimens should be confirmed based on local medical guidelines. Overall, diclofenac is a widely used medication for managing pain and inflammation, with its usage tailored to individual patient needs and regional regulations.\",2\r\n2392,环丙贝特,\"环丙贝特是一种苯氧芳酸类（或贝特类）药物，主要用于调节血脂，特别是治疗高甘油三酯血症（高TG血症）。作为贝特类药物的一种，环丙贝特通过激活过氧化物酶体增殖物激活受体（PPAR）来降低血液中的甘油三酯水平，同时可能对胆固醇代谢产生调节作用。其药理作用与其他贝特类药物相似，适用于血脂异常患者，尤其是以甘油三酯升高为主要特征的患者。  \n\n环丙贝特的临床应用侧重于改善脂质代谢紊乱，但其具体作用机制和适应症可能因个体情况而有所差异。综合来看，该药物在降血脂领域具有明确疗效，尤其针对高TG血症患者。\",3\r\n3321,西立伐他汀,西立伐他汀是一种他汀类药物，与吉非罗齐联用有致横纹肌溶解的报道>,1\r\n233,酮洛芬,\"**Ketoprofen (酮洛芬)** is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for managing musculoskeletal pain and acute inflammation. It is available in both topical and oral formulations, with the topical form specifically targeting localized pain relief. When administered orally, it is typically prescribed at a dosage of 50 mg three times daily due to its very short half-life of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours. This rapid metabolism necessitates frequent dosing to maintain therapeutic effects.  \n\nAs an NSAID, ketoprofen works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin production and alleviating pain and inflammation. Its short half-life makes it particularly suitable for acute conditions rather than chronic use. The topical formulation offers a targeted approach with potentially fewer systemic side effects compared to oral administration.  \n\nIn summary, ketoprofen is a versatile NSAID with applications in both localized and systemic pain management, characterized by its short duration of action and effectiveness in treating acute inflammatory conditions.\",1\r\n3247,OATP1B1,\"**OATP1B1 (Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1)** is a drug transporter protein that plays a critical role in the uptake and distribution of drugs, particularly in the liver. It facilitates the transport of various organic anions, including pharmaceuticals, influencing their absorption, distribution, and excretion. OATP1B1 is primarily expressed in the liver, where it mediates the uptake of drugs and other compounds from the blood into hepatocytes, thereby affecting their pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy. This transporter is essential for the hepatic clearance of many drugs, making it a key factor in drug-drug interactions and variability in drug response among individuals.  \n\nThe descriptions highlight its dual role in both drug distribution and excretion, as well as its specific function in hepatic drug uptake. Collectively, OATP1B1 is recognized as a significant transporter protein that impacts drug metabolism and disposition, with implications for pharmacology and personalized medicine.\",3\r\n3248,P-GP,\"**P-Glycoprotein (P-gp)** is a well-known transporter protein that plays a critical role in drug pharmacokinetics by influencing absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. It actively transports a wide range of drugs, including simvastatin and dabigatran etexilate, affecting their bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. P-gp is primarily involved in limiting drug absorption in the intestines, promoting drug excretion via the liver and kidneys, and modulating drug distribution across biological barriers such as the blood-brain barrier.  \n\nWhile some descriptions emphasize its role in drug metabolism, P-gp is more accurately characterized as a transporter rather than a metabolic enzyme. However, its activity indirectly influences drug metabolism by altering substrate availability for metabolic enzymes. Certain compounds, such as grapefruit juice, act as P-gp inhibitors, reducing its function and thereby increasing the systemic exposure of drugs that are P-gp substrates.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively highlight P-gp’s broad impact on drug disposition, with no major contradictions. Variations in phrasing (e.g., \"\"affects drug absorption and excretion\"\" vs. \"\"affects drug distribution and excretion\"\") reflect its multifaceted role rather than conflicting information. In summary, P-gp is a key transporter protein that regulates drug movement in the body, impacting therapeutic outcomes and interactions with inhibitors like grapefruit juice.\",9\r\n3264,瑞格列奈,\"瑞格列奈（Repaglinide）是一种口服降糖药，属于格列奈类药物，主要用于治疗2型糖尿病。它通过刺激胰腺β细胞释放胰岛素来降低血糖水平。瑞格列奈的代谢主要依赖于肝脏中的细胞色素P450酶系统，特别是CYP2C8和CYP3A4酶。  \n\n值得注意的是，瑞格列奈与某些药物合用时可能增加低血糖风险。例如，与氯吡格雷（一种抗血小板药物）或吉非罗齐（一种降脂药）联合使用时，可能因药物相互作用而增强瑞格列奈的降糖效果，从而引发低血糖。因此，临床使用时应密切监测血糖水平，必要时调整剂量以避免不良反应。  \n\n综上所述，瑞格列奈是一种经CYP2C8和CYP3A4代谢的降糖药，其疗效和安全性可能受合并用药影响，尤其是与氯吡格雷或吉非罗齐联用时需格外谨慎。\",4\r\n3269,氯吡格雷,,8\r\n3271,西格列汀,西格列汀是一种药物，少量经CYP3A4和CYP2C8代谢，是P-gp的底物，与地高辛合用时需谨慎,3\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1712,吉非罗齐,高脂血症,吉非罗齐用于治疗以三酰甘油升高为主的高脂血症。,122\r\n1711,非诺贝特,高脂血症,非诺贝特用于治疗以三酰甘油升高为主的高脂血症。,120\r\n356,中华全科医师杂志,奥美拉唑,The journal references PPIs like omeprazole for treating acid-related symptoms in dyspepsia,43\r\n2794,圣约翰草提取物,CYP3A4,圣约翰草提取物是典型的CYP3A4和P-gp诱导剂，与很多药物存在临床意义的相互作用,37\r\n2678,CYP3A4,CLARITHROMYCIN,Clarithromycin inhibits CYP3A4,32\r\n2679,CYP3A4,ERYTHROMYCIN,Erythromycin inhibits CYP3A4,32\r\n2827,那格列奈,CYP3A4,那格列奈 is metabolized by CYP3A4,32\r\n2654,卡格列净,CYP3A4,卡格列净（Canagliflozin）是一种钠-葡萄糖协同转运蛋白2（SGLT2）抑制剂，主要用于治疗2型糖尿病。在代谢途径方面，卡格列净的代谢程度较低，且仅有少量通过细胞色素P450酶CYP3A4进行代谢。具体而言，研究表明卡格列净仅有约7%经CYP3A4代谢，这表明CYP3A4在其代谢过程中作用有限，整体上卡格列净的代谢主要以非CYP途径为主。这一特性可能减少其与其他依赖CYP3A4代谢的药物发生相互作用的潜在风险。,31\r\n2670,CYP3A4,BISOPROLOL,Bisoprolol is metabolized by CYP3A4,31\r\n2673,CYP3A4,ATORVASTATIN,Atorvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4,31\r\n2675,CYP3A4,KETOCONAZOLE,Ketoconazole inhibits CYP3A4,31\r\n2676,CYP3A4,POSACONAZOLE,Posaconazole inhibits CYP3A4,31\r\n2677,CYP3A4,VORICONAZOLE,Voriconazole inhibits CYP3A4,31\r\n2680,CYP3A4,TELITHROMYCIN,Telithromycin inhibits CYP3A4,31\r\n2681,CYP3A4,AMIODARONE,Amiodarone moderately inhibits CYP3A4,31\r\n2682,CYP3A4,AMLODIPINE,Amlodipine moderately inhibits CYP3A4,31\r\n2683,CYP3A4,VERAPAMIL,Verapamil moderately inhibits CYP3A4,31\r\n2740,利伐沙班,CYP3A4,\"Rivaroxaban is metabolized by CYP3A4, increasing bleeding risk with inhibitors\",31\r\n156,秋水仙碱,非甾体抗炎药,秋水仙碱和非甾体抗炎药均为痛风急性发作的一线治疗药物，可单独或联合使用。,18\r\n159,非甾体抗炎药,糖皮质激素,糖皮质激素用于非甾体抗炎药无效或使用禁忌的患者。,13\r\n368,非甾体抗炎药,双氯芬酸,Diclofenac is a type of NSAID,13\r\n2491,非诺贝特,环丙贝特,非诺贝特和环丙贝特都是贝特类药物，主要用于治疗高TG血症,13\r\n2698,吉非罗齐,西立伐他汀,吉非罗齐与西立伐他汀联用有致横纹肌溶解的报道,13\r\n370,非甾体抗炎药,酮洛芬,Ketoprofen is a type of NSAID,12\r\n2630,OATP1B1,P-GP,Both OATP1B1 and P-gp are drug transporter proteins,12\r\n2640,瑞格列奈,氯吡格雷,\"瑞格列奈与氯吡格雷合用时存在显著的药物相互作用风险。氯吡格雷可能显著提高瑞格列奈的血药浓度，从而增加低血糖的发生概率。这一相互作用机制表明，两者联合使用需谨慎，并密切监测血糖水平以避免不良反应。  \n\n综合现有信息，瑞格列奈（一种快速作用的胰岛素促泌剂）与氯吡格雷（一种抗血小板药物）的联用可能导致协同效应，进一步加剧低血糖风险。因此，临床使用时应评估患者个体情况，必要时调整剂量或采取预防措施。\",12\r\n2644,西格列汀,P-GP,西格列汀是P-gp的底物,12\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
