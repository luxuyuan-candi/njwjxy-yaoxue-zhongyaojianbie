They function by increasing serotonin levels in the brain, which helps regulate mood. SSRIs are also frequently used during pregnancy, though with some considerations. While most SSRIs are considered relatively safe for use in pregnancy, paroxetine is an exception due to its association with an increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. However, SSRIs, including paroxetine, are not generally linked to fetal heart disease or death.  \n\nOverall, SSRIs remain a first-line treatment for depression and other mood disorders, balancing efficacy with a well-documented safety profile, though individual medications within the class may have specific risks that require careful evaluation, particularly in pregnant patients. The decision to use SSRIs during pregnancy should involve a thorough risk-benefit assessment by healthcare providers.\",9\r\n3525,SNRIS,\"**Summary of SNRIs (Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors):**  \n\nSNRIs, or Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors, are a class of antidepressants primarily used for the treatment of depression. They function by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, two neurotransmitters associated with mood regulation. SNRIs are among the commonly prescribed medications for depressive disorders due to their dual mechanism of action.  \n\nWhile effective for depression management, some studies suggest that SNRIs may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous miscarriage in pregnant individuals. This potential risk underscores the importance of careful consideration and consultation with healthcare providers when prescribing SNRIs to patients who are pregnant or planning pregnancy.  \n\nThe terms \"\"Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors\"\" and \"\"Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors\"\" are interchangeable, both referring to the same class of medications. SNRIs remain a widely recognized and utilized option in antidepressant therapy, though their use requires individualized assessment of benefits and risks, particularly in specific patient populations.\",8\r\n3528,MAOIS,\"Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors, a traditional class of antidepressants\",4\r\n3526,NASSA,\"Noradrenergic and Specific Serotonergic Antidepressants, a class of antidepressants\",4\r\n3539,卒中后抑郁,\"Post-stroke depression, a condition affecting 30%-40% of stroke survivors, impacting rehabilitation and cognitive function\",2\r\n3540,心血管系统疾病,\"Cardiovascular diseases, which have a high comorbidity rate with depression, increasing mortality risk\",2\r\n2781,FDA,\"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a federal regulatory agency responsible for overseeing the safety, efficacy, and security of food, drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and other consumer products in the United States.

For instance, in 2000, the FDA listed diacylglycerol oil as a GRAS substance, indicating its approval for use in food products based on scientific evidence. Additionally, the FDA assesses the safety of pharmaceuticals, such as antidepressants, and provides guidance on their use during pregnancy, categorizing them based on potential risks and benefits.
