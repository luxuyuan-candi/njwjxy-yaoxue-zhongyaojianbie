It serves as a leading authority in setting guidelines for disease prevention, treatment, and public health policies worldwide. The WHO conducts extensive research on a wide range of health conditions, including mental health issues such as depression, to provide evidence-based recommendations and support to member states.  \n\nAs a specialized agency of the United Nations, the WHO plays a pivotal role in coordinating international health efforts, responding to health emergencies, and advancing universal healthcare access. Its work encompasses disease surveillance, health education, and the development of global health standards to improve outcomes for populations across the globe. By bridging scientific research with practical health interventions, the WHO strives to address both communicable and non-communicable diseases, ensuring equitable health solutions for all.\",2\r\n189,美国,\"**Summary of Data on the United States (美国):**  \n\nThe **United States (美国)** is a country with significant health-related trends and challenges, as evidenced by multiple studies and reports. Research from the International Consortium of Psychiatric Epidemiology (ICPE) indicates that the U.S. has a high lifetime prevalence of depression, highlighting mental health as a critical public health concern. Additionally, the country's tiered healthcare system has been studied for its implications, particularly in comparison to China's healthcare reforms, suggesting its influence on global healthcare policy discussions.  \n\nThe U.S. has also been associated with increased cardiovascular disease incidence among Inuit (Eskimo) populations following migration, pointing to potential lifestyle or environmental factors affecting health outcomes. Furthermore, the prevalence of gout has risen steadily, increasing from 2.64% (1988–1994) to 3.76% (2007–2010), possibly linked to dietary changes or metabolic risk factors.  \n\nContradictory findings exist regarding cholesterol levels and mortality. Some U.S. medical reports suggest that low cholesterol levels may correlate with higher mortality risks, particularly in elderly populations. Conversely, American scientists have found that elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels may protect against coronary heart disease, underscoring the complexity of lipid metabolism in health outcomes.  \n\nIn summary, the U.S. faces diverse health challenges, including mental health disparities, healthcare system complexities, rising metabolic disorders, and conflicting evidence on cardiovascular risk factors. These findings reflect the multifaceted nature of public health in the country.
