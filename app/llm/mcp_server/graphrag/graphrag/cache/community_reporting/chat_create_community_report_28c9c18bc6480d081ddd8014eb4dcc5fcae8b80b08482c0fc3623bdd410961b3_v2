It manifests as conditions such as angina, myocardial infarction, and sudden cardiac death. CHD is closely associated with dyslipidemia, particularly elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, making hyperlipidemia a major independent risk factor. Other contributing factors include hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and smoking.  \n\nAccording to the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines, CHD is considered equivalent in risk to diabetes for patients with hyperlipidemia, necessitating strict lipid control. Long-term lipid-lowering treatment can prevent or delay its progression, and statins like atorvastatin calcium have been shown to reduce risk by improving lipid profiles and blood pressure. Additionally, lifestyle interventions such as exercise improve myocardial function, promote collateral circulation, and aid in prevention.  \n\nCHD poses a significant global health threat, with mortality rates in developed countries exceeding those of all cancers combined, accounting for 27.4% of total deaths. In China, urban areas like Beijing and Shanghai are seeing rising incidence rates approaching those of Western nations. Management emphasizes lipid-lowering therapy as one of the three modern treatment approaches, alongside dietary modifications (e.g., flavonoids in apples may reduce mortality risk).  \n\nWhile CHD is primarily linked to high lipid levels, extremely low cholesterol in elderly patients may also be a concern. The disease underscores the importance of regular lipid monitoring and aggressive risk factor modification to mitigate its severe consequences.\",51\r\n3414,欧美国家,\"欧美国家是冠心病和高脂血症的高发地区，冠心病病死率已超过所有癌症病人病死率的总和\"\"\",2\r\n3463,载脂蛋白A1,\"载脂蛋白A1具有保护动脉内皮的作用，能促进胆固醇代谢，防止动脉粥样硬化\"\"\",2\r\n3510,经皮冠状动脉内成形术,经皮冠状动脉内成形术（PTCA）是一种用于治疗冠心病的心血管手术方法。该手术通过微创介入的方式扩张狭窄或阻塞的冠状动脉，以恢复血流，改善心肌供血。研究表明，鱼油制剂可能有助于预防术后冠状动脉再狭窄，从而提升手术的长期效果。经皮冠状动脉内成形术是冠心病治疗中的重要手段之一，兼具治疗性和预防性作用。,2\r\n3386,冠状动脉,,1\r\n3511,冠状动脉搭桥手术,冠状动脉搭桥手术是治疗冠心病的一种手术方法,1\r\n3581,冠状动脉腔内成形术,\"冠状动脉腔内成形术是一种治疗冠心病的手术方法\"\"\",1\r\n3996,冠状动脉粥样硬化,,1\r\n3995,血清胆固醇,\"血清胆固醇水平是评估高脂血症和冠心病风险的重要指标\"\"\",3\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n4049,心绞痛,高脂血症,Hyperlipidemia increases risk of angina by contributing to arterial blockages,237\r\n2896,高脂血症,总胆固醇,\"高脂血症（Hyperlipidemia）是一种以血液中脂质水平异常升高为特征的代谢性疾病，其中总胆固醇（Total Cholesterol）的升高是诊断该病的重要指标之一。根据提供的描述，无论是“Elevated total cholesterol is a key diagnostic criterion for hyperlipidemia”还是“总胆固醇升高是混合性高脂血症的诊断标准”，均明确指出总胆固醇水平的上升与高脂血症（包括混合性高脂血症）的诊断密切相关。  \n\n高脂血症可分为多种亚型，而混合性高脂血症是其中一种常见类型，表现为总胆固醇和甘油三酯同时升高。总胆固醇作为核心指标之一，其异常水平不仅用于初步筛查，还帮助医生进一步区分高脂血症的具体类型。两项描述虽表述语言不同（英文与中文），但内容一致，均强调了总胆固醇在高脂血症诊断中的关键作用，不存在矛盾。  \n\n综上，高脂血症的诊断依赖于包括总胆固醇在内的多项血脂参数评估，而总胆固醇升高是该疾病（尤其是混合性高脂血症）的核心诊断依据之一。这一结论适用于临床实践及患者管理。\",236\r\n2908,高脂血症,高胆固醇血症,高脂血症可根据发生异常改变的血脂成分分为不同类型，包括高胆固醇血症,236\r\n2973,高脂血症,运动锻炼,运动锻炼可以改善血脂代谢，是高脂血症的积极防治措施之一。,236\r\n3476,降脂治疗,冠心病,Lipid-lowering treatment can prevent or delay the onset of coronary heart disease,60\r\n2732,冠心病,血脂革命,冠心病是一种常见的心血管疾病，而“血脂革命”是一种通过调节和控制血脂水平来降低冠心病发病风险的健康管理方法。该方法强调通过科学手段改善血脂代谢，从而有效构筑冠心病的预防防线。具体而言，“血脂革命”通过降低血液中的低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL-C）和甘油三酯等有害血脂成分，同时提升高密度脂蛋白胆固醇（HDL-C）的水平，以减少动脉粥样硬化的发生和发展，进而降低冠心病的危险。这一方法结合了饮食调整、运动干预和必要的药物治疗，旨在从根源上减少冠心病的诱发因素，为患者和潜在高危人群提供了一种综合性的健康解决方案。,53\r\n3133,冠心病,欧美国家,欧美国家冠心病病死率极高，已超过所有癌症病人病死率总和,53\r\n3259,载脂蛋白A1,冠心病,载脂蛋白A1水平下降易发生冠心病,53\r\n3372,冠心病,经皮冠状动脉内成形术,经皮冠状动脉内成形术用于治疗冠心病,53\r\n3073,冠心病,冠状动脉,冠状动脉粥样硬化直接导致冠心病,52\r\n3373,冠心病,冠状动脉搭桥手术,冠状动脉搭桥手术用于治疗冠心病,52\r\n3495,冠心病,冠状动脉腔内成形术,冠状动脉腔内成形术用于治疗冠心病,52\r\n4071,冠心病,冠状动脉粥样硬化,冠状动脉粥样硬化是冠心病的主要病理基础,52\r\n4074,血清胆固醇,脑出血,脑出血发病率与血清胆固醇水平存在关联，过低可能增加风险,7\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
