It contains natural lovastatin and its analogs, along with other bioactive compounds, which contribute to its efficacy in managing hypercholesterolemia, particularly mild to moderate cases. As a statin-based drug, it reduces blood lipid levels and has been shown to lower the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile.  \n\nIn addition to its cholesterol-lowering effects, 血脂康 may assist in reducing blood sugar levels in diabetic patients, though its primary indication remains lipid regulation. It is classified as a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) preparation but shares pharmacological similarities with conventional statins due to its lovastatin content.  \n\nProduced domestically in China, 血脂康 is widely prescribed to modulate lipid metabolism and is recognized for its dual role as both a natural remedy and a clinically validated treatment for dyslipidemia. Its multi-component formulation distinguishes it from synthetic statins, offering a unique therapeutic profile within cardiovascular and metabolic care.  \n\n(Word count: 178)\",11\r\n3094,中国冠心病二级预防研究,中国冠心病二级预防研究证实血脂康具有明确的降脂作用，可降低心血管事件和死亡风险,1\r\n2744,贝特类,贝特类药物是一类降脂药物，通常与他汀类药物合用，但需注意不良反应,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1998,他汀类,血脂康,血脂康是一种他汀类药物，用于治疗高胆固醇血症。,13\r\n2486,血脂康,中国冠心病二级预防研究,中国冠心病二级预防研究证实血脂康具有明确的降脂作用,12\r\n2112,他汀类,贝特类,他汀类和贝特类药物可以合用，但需注意不良反应,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
