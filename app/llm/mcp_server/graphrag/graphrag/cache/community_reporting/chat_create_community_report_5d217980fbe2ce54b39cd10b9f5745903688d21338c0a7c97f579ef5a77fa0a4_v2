It is primarily used to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by binding to bile acids in the intestine, preventing their reabsorption and promoting their excretion. However, while effective in reducing LDL cholesterol, cholestyramine may also lead to an increase in triglyceride levels as a potential side effect. This dual effect underscores its role as a targeted therapy for managing hypercholesterolemia while requiring monitoring for alterations in lipid profiles. The medication is commonly prescribed for conditions such as primary hypercholesterolemia and pruritus associated with partial biliary obstruction. Its oral administration and specific dosing regimen make it a structured treatment option under clinical supervision.\",2\r\n4087,BILE ACID SEQUESTRANTS,\"**Bile Acid Sequestrants** are a class of drugs primarily used to lower lipid and cholesterol levels in the blood. This group includes medications such as **cholestyramine** (考来烯胺), **colestipol** (降胆宁), and **colesevelam**. These drugs function by binding to bile acids in the intestine, preventing their reabsorption into the bloodstream. By disrupting the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, bile acid sequestrants force the liver to utilize more cholesterol to produce new bile acids, thereby reducing circulating cholesterol levels.  \n\nBile acid sequestrants are commonly prescribed to manage hypercholesterolemia and are often used in conjunction with other lipid-lowering therapies. While effective, they may cause gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation or bloating. Their mechanism of action makes them particularly useful for patients who cannot tolerate statins or require additional cholesterol-lowering support.  \n\nThe descriptions provided consistently highlight the role of bile acid sequestrants in cholesterol management, emphasizing their binding action in the intestine and subsequent impact on lipid metabolism. No contradictions were found in the given data. Overall, these drugs serve as a valuable therapeutic option for reducing cardiovascular risk by targeting cholesterol levels.\",4\r\n4555,COLESTIPOL,\"Colestipol is a bile acid sequestrant administered orally, 5 g per dose, three times daily\"\"\",1\r\n4556,COLESEVELAM,\"Colesevelam is a bile acid sequestrant administered orally, 1.875 g per dose, twice daily\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n4085,DIABETES,CHOLESTYRAMINE,Cholestyramine is not recommended for diabetic patients due to its effect on triglyceride levels,33\r\n4807,BILE ACID SEQUESTRANTS,CHOLESTYRAMINE,Cholestyramine is a type of bile acid sequestrant,6\r\n4808,BILE ACID SEQUESTRANTS,COLESTIPOL,Colestipol is a type of bile acid sequestrant,5\r\n4809,BILE ACID SEQUESTRANTS,COLESEVELAM,Colesevelam is a type of bile acid sequestrant,5\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
