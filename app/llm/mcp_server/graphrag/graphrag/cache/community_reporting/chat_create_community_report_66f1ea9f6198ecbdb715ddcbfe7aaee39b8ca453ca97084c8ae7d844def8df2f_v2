This condition can result from various causes, including drug interactions, particularly those involving statins and CYP3A4 inhibitors. Statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering medications, are known to carry a risk of rhabdomyolysis as a severe adverse effect, especially when combined with drugs that inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme, as this interaction can increase statin concentrations in the body and exacerbate muscle toxicity. The breakdown of muscle tissue may also occur due to other factors, such as trauma, extreme physical exertion, or metabolic disorders, but drug-induced cases highlight the importance of monitoring medication regimens to prevent this potentially life-threatening complication. Early recognition and treatment are critical to managing rhabdomyolysis and preventing further complications, such as kidney damage.\",3\r\n4863,SEVERE HEPATIC INJURY,Serious liver damage that can result from drug interactions,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n5114,RESPIRATORY MUSCLE PARALYSIS,RHABDOMYOLYSIS,Both are neuromuscular complications from drug interactions,4\r\n5115,RHABDOMYOLYSIS,SEVERE HEPATIC INJURY,Both are organ damage events from drug interactions,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
