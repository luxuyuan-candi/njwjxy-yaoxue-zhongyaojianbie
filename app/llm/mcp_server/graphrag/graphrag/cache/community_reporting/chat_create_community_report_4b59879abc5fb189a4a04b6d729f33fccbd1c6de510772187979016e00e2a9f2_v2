Classified as a medium-intensity statin, it works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol production in the liver. Pitavastatin is prescribed to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Its efficacy and safety profile make it a viable option for patients requiring moderate lipid-lowering therapy. The drug is available in oral form and is typically administered once daily, often as part of a broader treatment plan that includes dietary and lifestyle modifications.\",2\r\n4849,OATP1B1,\"**OATP1B1 (Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide 1B1)** is a liver-specific drug transporter protein that plays a critical role in the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of various drugs, particularly statins. It facilitates the uptake of drugs and other organic anions into hepatocytes, influencing their pharmacokinetics and therapeutic effects. OATP1B1 is primarily expressed in the liver, where it mediates the transport of substrates such as statins, impacting their absorption and metabolism.  \n\nAdditionally, OATP1B1 activity can be inhibited by certain drugs, such as cyclosporine (环孢素), which may alter the pharmacokinetics of co-administered medications that rely on this transporter. The protein's function is essential for drug disposition, and its inhibition or genetic variability can lead to changes in drug efficacy and toxicity.  \n\nIn summary, OATP1B1 is a key hepatic transporter involved in drug uptake, particularly for statins, and its activity can be modulated by inhibitors like cyclosporine, affecting overall drug metabolism and clinical outcomes.\",4\r\n4906,环孢素,\"**环孢素（Cyclosporine）**是一种免疫抑制剂，具有多重药物相互作用机制，主要通过抑制多种转运蛋白和代谢酶影响其他药物的血药浓度及安全性。  \n\n环孢素是OATP1B1（有机阴离子转运多肽1B1）的强效抑制剂，可减少肝细胞对他汀类药物（如辛伐他汀、瑞舒伐他汀、阿托伐他汀）的摄取，导致其血药浓度显著升高，从而增加肌肉毒性（如横纹肌溶解症）和肝脏毒性的风险。此外，环孢素还能抑制CYP3A4和P-糖蛋白（P-gp），但与阿格列汀合用时未观察到具有临床意义的相互作用。  \n\n具体而言：  \n1. **与他汀类药物的相互作用**：环孢素通过抑制OATP1B1，减少他汀类药物的肝脏摄取，提高其全身暴露量，增加肌肉和肝脏毒性风险，尤其是辛伐他汀、瑞舒伐他汀和阿托伐他汀。  \n2. **与阿格列汀的相互作用**：尽管环孢素是P-gp抑制剂，但研究显示其与阿格列汀的联合用药未产生显著临床影响。  \n3. **多重抑制作用**：环孢素对CYP3A4、P-gp和OATP1B1的广泛抑制使其成为药物相互作用的重要调节剂，需谨慎联用经这些途径代谢或转运的药物。  \n\n综上，环孢素作为免疫抑制剂，在临床应用中需密切监测与其他药物（尤其是他汀类）的相互作用，以避免严重不良反应。\",9\r\n2076,瑞舒伐他汀,\"**瑞舒伐他汀（Rosuvastatin）** 是一种他汀类药物，主要用于治疗动脉粥样硬化（atherosclerosis），其疗效在ASTEROID研究中得到验证。与其他他汀类药物相比，瑞舒伐他汀的代谢程度较低，但它的药代动力学特性可能受到药物相互作用的影响，尤其是与OATP1B1抑制剂（如环孢素）合用时。  \n\n研究表明，当瑞舒伐他汀与环孢素联合使用时，其血药浓度-时间曲线下面积（AUC）和峰值浓度（Cmax）会显著增加，这主要是由于环孢素抑制了OATP1B1介导的瑞舒伐他汀转运。这种相互作用可能导致药物在体内的暴露量升高，进而增加肌肉毒性（如横纹肌溶解症）和肝脏毒性的风险。因此，临床使用时应谨慎评估联合用药的必要性，并密切监测患者的不良反应。  \n\n综上所述，瑞舒伐他汀是一种高效且代谢较少的他汀类药物，但其与环孢素等OATP1B1抑制剂的相互作用可能带来严重风险，需在医生指导下合理使用。\",5\r\n4892,阿格列汀,阿格列汀是一种药物，基本不经CYP450酶代谢，不是P-gp底物，与地高辛和环孢素合用无临床意义的相互作用,1\r\n2075,ASTEROID,\"ASTEROID is a research study that showed rosuvastatin treatment could reduce atherosclerotic plaque volume by 0.79%, fundamentally preventing cardiovascular events\",1\r\n4851,OCT,OCT is a drug transporter protein that affects drug distribution and excretion,2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n4785,LDL-C,匹伐他汀,Pitavastatin is a statin that lowers LDL-C levels,42\r\n5106,OATP1B1,P-GP,Both OATP1B1 and P-gp are drug transporter proteins,21\r\n5228,环孢素,瑞舒伐他汀,环孢素作为OATP1B1抑制剂，与瑞舒伐他汀合用可能增加横纹肌溶解症的风险,14\r\n5285,瑞舒伐他汀,环孢素,\"瑞舒伐他汀（rosuvastatin）与环孢素（cyclosporine）之间存在显著的药物相互作用。环孢素通过抑制肝脏转运蛋白OATP1B1，显著增加瑞舒伐他汀在血液中的浓度。这一相互作用导致瑞舒伐他汀的药代动力学参数发生变化，具体表现为其血药浓度-时间曲线下面积（AUC）和峰值浓度（Cmax）的升高。由于瑞舒伐他汀的治疗窗较窄，这种浓度的增加可能提高其不良反应的风险，包括肌肉毒性（如肌病或横纹肌溶解）和肝脏毒性。因此，当瑞舒伐他汀与环孢素联合使用时，需密切监测患者的不良反应，并考虑调整瑞舒伐他汀的剂量以降低潜在风险。  \n\n（注：总结已整合两项描述，统一了机制与临床影响，并保持第三人称客观表述，字数控制在500字内。）\",14\r\n5137,阿格列汀,环孢素,阿格列汀与环孢素合用不存在临床意义的相互作用,10\r\n1742,ASTEROID,瑞舒伐他汀,The ASTEROID study used rosuvastatin to demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing atherosclerotic plaque,6\r\n5107,OATP1B1,OCT,Both OATP1B1 and OCT are drug transporter proteins,6\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
