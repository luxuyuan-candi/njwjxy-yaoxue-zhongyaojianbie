CKD is a significant comorbidity that exacerbates cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients and is commonly observed in individuals with peripheral artery disease (PAD) or diabetes. It influences blood pressure management, often necessitating stricter control (e.g., targets below 130/80 mmHg if tolerated). CKD also requires careful monitoring when using angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) due to potential effects on potassium and creatinine levels. Additionally, CKD stages 3-4 are considered high-risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The condition is frequently mentioned as a complication in hypertension management and may impact blood pressure targets in patients with other comorbidities, such as tumors. CKD is recognized globally, including in contexts where it is referred to as 慢性肾脏病 (CKD), highlighting its role as a key complication in hypertensive and diabetic patients.  \n\nThis summary integrates all provided descriptions, resolving minor redundancies while maintaining coherence and completeness.\",36\n1279,Α受体阻滞剂,\"**Α受体阻滞剂 (Alpha-blockers)** are a class of drugs primarily used as antihypertensive agents, particularly in specific clinical scenarios. They are effective in treating renal vascular hypertension when used as part of combination therapy. Additionally, they are indicated for hypertension cases complicated by conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), essential tremor, abnormal glucose or lipid metabolism, and refractory hypertension.  \n\nΑ受体阻滞剂 also play a critical role in the preoperative management of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), where they are routinely administered to prepare patients for surgery. Their versatility makes them suitable for both general hypertension treatment and specialized clinical situations, including BPH and metabolic disorders.  \n\nIn summary, Α受体阻滞剂 serve as a multifaceted therapeutic option, addressing hypertension in complex cases while also being essential in surgical preparations for PPGL.\",3\n1299,利尿剂,\"利尿剂（Diuretics）是一类降压药（antihypertensive drug），通过促进利尿（diuresis）发挥作用。它们被纳入治疗肾血管性高血压（renal vascular hypertension）的多药联合方案中，同时也适用于下肢动脉疾病合并高血压患者的初始联合降压治疗。此外，利尿剂与其他药物的相互作用较小，尤其是与抗抑郁药的相互作用较少。  \n\n然而，在手术前需注意调整用药，通常建议在术前2-3天停用利尿剂，以避免电解质紊乱（electrolyte imbalances）的风险。  \n\n综上，利尿剂作为一类重要的降压药物，在多种高血压治疗方案中具有明确作用，但需根据临床情况（如手术前）调整使用，以确保安全性和疗效。\",6\n1577,DM,\"DM stands for diabetes, a chronic condition mentioned in the context of hypertension management\"\"\",3\n1562,Β-RECEPTOR BLOCKERS,\"**Β-RECEPTOR BLOCKERS (Beta-Blockers)** are a class of medications known for their protective effects on the heart, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). They work by counteracting the overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system, which helps reduce cardiovascular strain. Additionally, beta-blockers are considered safe and effective for continuation during perioperative hypertension management, making them a versatile option for both chronic and acute clinical scenarios. Their dual role in cardioprotection and perioperative care highlights their importance in managing cardiovascular and renal conditions.\",2\n1564,LOOP DIURETICS,Loop diuretics are recommended for CKD patients with eGFR <30mL/(min·1.73m²),1\n1116,ARNI,\"**ARNI (Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitor)** is a class of antihypertensive and cardiovascular medications that combines the effects of an **angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB)** and **neprilysin inhibition**. Primarily used for **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**, ARNI improves prognosis, reduces hospitalization rates, and lowers mortality in these patients. It is also effective in **hypertension management**, often used in combination with other medications for blood pressure control.  \n\nAdditionally, ARNI has shown benefits in **chronic kidney disease (CKD)** by reducing proteinuria and slowing kidney function decline. Some formulations, such as **sacubitril/valsartan (沙库巴曲缬沙坦)**, are specifically approved for **hypertension and heart failure treatment**, though clinicians must consider potential drug interactions.  \n\nARNI may also **improve hyperuricemia** (high uric acid levels). However, due to its vasodilatory effects, it can contribute to **intraoperative hypotension**, and guidelines recommend pausing ARNI **24 hours before surgery** to mitigate this risk.  \n\nRecognized in the **2018 Chinese Hypertension Guidelines**, ARNI represents a newer therapeutic approach for cardiovascular and renal conditions, offering combined **renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition** and neprilysin blockade. Its dual mechanism makes it valuable in managing **post-myocardial infarction** cases and other cardiovascular diseases.  \n\nIn summary, ARNI is a versatile drug class with applications in **heart failure, hypertension, CKD, and hyperuricemia**, though perioperative caution is advised.\",16\n1102,Β受体阻滞剂,\"**Β受体阻滞剂 (Beta-blockers)** are a class of drugs widely used in the treatment of hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions. They function by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors, thereby inhibiting sympathetic nervous system activity, reducing heart rate, and decreasing myocardial contractility, which collectively lower blood pressure. Β受体阻滞剂 are recommended as a **first-line treatment** for hypertensive patients with elevated heart rate and are also effective in managing **renal vascular hypertension**.  \n\nThese medications are categorized into subtypes, including **non-selective beta-blockers**, **highly selective β1-blockers**, and **α1/β-blockers**, each with specific clinical applications. They are particularly beneficial for patients with comorbid conditions such as **coronary artery disease (CAD)**, **chronic heart failure (HFrEF)**, and **aortic dissection**, where they improve prognosis, reduce hospitalization rates, and lower mortality. Additionally, β受体阻滞剂 are used as **adjunctive therapy for tachycardia** in preoperative preparation for pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma (PPGL) and are considered safe for hypertensive patients with **lower extremity arterial stenosis**.  \n\nBeyond cardiovascular uses, β受体阻滞剂 are prescribed for **hyperthyroidism-related hypertension** due to their ability to counteract excessive adrenergic stimulation. However, they may cause side effects such as **fatigue** and **cold extremities** and can **mask hypoglycemia symptoms** in diabetic patients, requiring cautious use.  \n\nΒ受体阻滞剂 can be combined with other antihypertensive agents, such as **ARNI (angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors)**, for enhanced therapeutic effects. Overall, they remain a cornerstone in hypertension and cardiovascular disease management, with both traditional and evolving clinical applications.\",19\n1276,慢性阻塞性肺疾病,,1\n1118,SPC,\"**Single Pill Combination (SPC)** refers to a treatment strategy for hypertension that combines multiple antihypertensive medications into a single pill. This approach is designed to improve patient adherence to treatment by simplifying medication regimens and enhancing convenience. SPC therapy is also recognized for its potential to increase treatment efficacy, as it ensures consistent intake of prescribed drug combinations. The method has been endorsed by clinical guidelines, including the **2018 Chinese Hypertension Guidelines**, which recommend the use of SPCs for managing hypertension. Overall, SPC represents an efficient and patient-friendly solution for optimizing blood pressure control.\",9\n1120,THIAZIDE DIURETICS,,9\n1297,CHINESE HYPERTENSION INTERVENTION EFFICACY STUDY,\"A study demonstrating the efficacy of small-dose long-acting dihydropyridine CCB + ARB as initial treatment for hypertension patients, significantly improving blood pressure control rate\"\"\",1\n1298,FEVER,\"A study confirming that dihydropyridine CCB + thiazide diuretic treatment can reduce the risk of stroke in hypertension patients\"\"\",1\n1578,CVD,\"CVD stands for cardiovascular disease, a condition mentioned in the context of hypertension management\"\"\",3\n1115,2018 CHINESE HYPERTENSION GUIDELINES,\"The 2018 Chinese Hypertension Guidelines recommended common antihypertensive drugs including CCB, ACEI, ARB, thiazide diuretics, and beta-blockers, and introduced ARNI as a new class of antihypertensive drugs\",4\n1523,SEVERE HYPERTENSION,\"Severe hypertension in pregnant women requires urgent treatment to minimize maternal and perinatal complications. Management includes determining the duration of treatment, target blood pressure, drug selection, and indications for terminating pregnancy.\"\"\",3\n1563,NSAIDS,\"**NSAIDs (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs)** are a class of medications known for their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. However, their use is associated with potential adverse effects, including the risk of **hypertension**, which may necessitate treatment with calcium channel blockers (CCBs), central antihypertensive drugs, ACE inhibitors/ARBs, or diuretics. Additionally, NSAIDs can contribute to **renal impairment**, particularly in patients with **chronic kidney disease (CKD)**, and are therefore advised to be used with caution or avoided in such individuals. These risks highlight the importance of careful monitoring and consideration of alternative therapies in susceptible populations.\",3\n1600,PERIOPERATIVE HYPERTENSION,\"Perioperative hypertension is defined as an increase in blood pressure by more than 30% from baseline or blood pressure ≥140/90mmHg during the perioperative period\"\"\",4\n1114,TIME STUDY,\"The TIME study (Time of Hypertension Medication Evaluation) was a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint clinical trial conducted in the United Kingdom. It aimed to compare the effects of evening versus morning dosing of antihypertensive medications on cardiovascular outcomes. The study found no significant additional cardiovascular benefits associated with taking antihypertensive drugs in the evening compared to the morning. These results suggest that the timing of antihypertensive medication administration may not have a substantial impact on cardiovascular risk reduction.\",2\n1522,NON-SEVERE HYPERTENSION,\"Non-severe hypertension in pregnant women requires initiating antihypertensive treatment and adjusting medication based on blood pressure levels during pregnancy.
