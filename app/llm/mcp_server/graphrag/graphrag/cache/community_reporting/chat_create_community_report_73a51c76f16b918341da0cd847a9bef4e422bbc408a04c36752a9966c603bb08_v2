ACEIs are widely used to treat **hypertension** and are particularly recommended for patients with comorbid conditions such as **diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), proteinuria, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), chronic heart failure (HFrEF), chronic coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and peripheral artery disease (PAD)**. They improve prognosis in **heart failure patients** by reducing hospitalization rates and mortality and may also enhance walking distance in **PAD patients with hypertension**.  \n\nACEIs are considered **first-line therapy** for hypertension in **diabetic patients**, as they help protect target organs without worsening metabolic conditions. They are also recommended for **systemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma renal crisis**. However, they should **not be combined with ARBs (Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers) or direct renin inhibitors** due to increased risks of **kidney events and hyperkalemia**. Additionally, ACEIs are **contraindicated in pregnancy** due to potential fetal risks and should be **discontinued one day before surgery** to avoid **intraoperative hypotension**.  \n\nWhen transitioning from ACEIs to **ARNIs (Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitors)**, a washout period of **at least 36 hours** is required. Some studies suggest ACEIs may also be associated with a **reduced risk of mood disorders**. Common examples of ACEIs include **captopril and fosinopril**, which are also used in pediatric hypertension management.  \n\nIn summary, ACEIs are a versatile class of **RAS inhibitors** with broad applications in cardiovascular and renal diseases, serving as a foundational therapy in **combined antihypertensive regimens**, especially for high-risk patients.\",53\n1152,CHRONIC CORONARY HEART DISEASE,\"**CHRONIC CORONARY HEART DISEASE** is a condition characterized by the narrowing of the coronary arteries, which reduces blood flow to the heart.
