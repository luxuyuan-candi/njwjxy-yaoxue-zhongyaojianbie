It is often caused by factors such as hypertension and results from a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain. While the effects of a TIA are short-lived, the condition significantly increases the risk of a future stroke, making it a critical warning sign that requires medical attention.\",4\n890,LVH,\"**Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH)** is a cardiac condition characterized by the thickening of the heart's left ventricle, often resulting from increased pressure load due to underlying conditions such as **hypertension** or **aortic stenosis**. LVH is recognized as a **typical target organ damage** caused by chronic hypertension and serves as an **independent risk factor for cardiovascular events**, including **heart failure** and **stroke**. It forms a critical link in the event chain where hypertension progresses to more severe cardiac complications.  \n\nWhile LVH is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, studies indicate that it can be **reversed with antihypertensive treatment**, leading to an improved prognosis. This reversibility underscores the importance of early detection and management. Additionally, LVH is frequently observed as a **cardiac complication in hypertensive patients**, further emphasizing its clinical significance in cardiovascular health.  \n\nIn summary, LVH is both a **predictor and consequence** of cardiovascular disease, with its development and progression closely tied to hypertension. Timely intervention through blood pressure control can mitigate risks and improve patient outcomes.\",16\n1426,氯沙坦干预降低高血压患者终点实践研究,氯沙坦干预降低高血压患者终点实践研究表明降压治疗逆转 LVH 可降低心血管事件发生和死亡风险,2\n955,SOKOLOW-LYON VOLTAGE,Sokolow-Lyon voltage is a method used to screen for LVH via electrocardiogram,1\n956,CORNELL VOLTAGE-TIME PRODUCT,Cornell voltage-time product is another method used to screen for LVH via electrocardiogram,1\n960,超声心动图,\"超声心动图 (echocardiography) is a diagnostic method used to detect LVH and assess cardiac damage from hypertension\"\"\",1\n961,心电图,\"心电图 (electrocardiogram) is a screening tool for LVH and other cardiac abnormalities related to hypertension\"\"\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1586,TIA,HYPERTENSION,Hypertension increases the risk of Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA),187\n715,LVH,HEART FAILURE,Left ventricular hypertrophy forms part of the hypertension-heart failure event chain,26\n1395,氯沙坦干预降低高血压患者终点实践研究,LVH,氯沙坦干预降低高血压患者终点实践研究显示降压治疗可逆转LVH,18\n801,LVH,SOKOLOW-LYON VOLTAGE,Sokolow-Lyon voltage is used to screen for LVH,17\n802,LVH,CORNELL VOLTAGE-TIME PRODUCT,Cornell voltage-time product is used to screen for LVH,17\n805,LVH,超声心动图,Echocardiography is used to diagnose LVH,17\n806,LVH,心电图,Electrocardiogram is used to screen for LVH,17\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
