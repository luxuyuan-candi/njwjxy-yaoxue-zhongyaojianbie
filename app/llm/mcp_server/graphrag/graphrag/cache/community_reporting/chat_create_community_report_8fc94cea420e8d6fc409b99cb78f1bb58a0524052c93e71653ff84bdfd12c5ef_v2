This process increases the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks, strokes, and other complications. ASCVD is a major public health concern, particularly in China, where it is the leading cause of death among urban and rural residents, accounting for over 40% of fatalities.  \n\nASCVD risk is assessed through stratification methods, categorizing individuals as low, medium, or high risk based on factors like smoking, low HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), age, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. This risk assessment is used to guide clinical decisions, including lipid-lowering treatments such as statins, which are commonly prescribed for prevention and management. Additionally, ASCVD risk stratification helps determine target LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) levels, especially for patients with comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes.  \n\nManagement strategies for ASCVD include lifestyle interventions (e.g., diet, exercise) and medication to control cholesterol levels and other risk factors. Regular lipid monitoring is essential for both prevention and treatment. Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) is also a significant predictor of ASCVD events, further linking dyslipidemia and hypertension to disease progression.  \n\nWhile some descriptions refer to the condition as \"\"Arteriosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease,\"\" the more widely accepted term is **Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD)**, emphasizing the role of plaque buildup in arterial walls. The condition remains a critical focus of cardiovascular risk assessment and lipid management worldwide.\",27\r\n840,LDL-C,\"**Summary of LDL-C (Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol):**  \n\nLDL-C, or Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol, is commonly referred to as \"\"bad cholesterol\"\" due to its well-established association with cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is a key lipid parameter used in assessing cardiovascular risk, particularly in hypertensive patients and those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Elevated LDL-C levels contribute to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing the likelihood of CVD, making it a primary target for lipid-lowering therapies.  \n\nAs a critical factor in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health, LDL-C is often monitored and managed through pharmacological interventions, with various drugs specifically designed to lower its levels. Its role in ASCVD and other cardiovascular conditions underscores its importance in clinical risk assessment and treatment strategies.  \n\nIn summary, LDL-C is a major cardiovascular risk factor, linked to arterial plaque formation and CVD, and is a central focus in preventive and therapeutic approaches to improve lipid profiles and reduce disease progression.\",21\r\n1354,RASI,\"Renin-angiotensin system inhibitor, a class of drugs used to treat hypertension by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system\"\"\",2\r\n1408,DYSLIPIDEMIA,,2\r\n3076,中国血脂管理指南（2023 年）,\"Chinese guidelines for lipid management, providing ASCVD risk assessment methods based on domestic population data\",2\r\n2026,血脂水平分层,,1\r\n2036,CABG,Coronary artery bypass grafting is a surgical procedure for treating coronary artery disease,1\r\n2039,CHINESE ADULTS,\"Chinese adults are the target population for the ASCVD risk assessment and management strategies outlined.\"\"\",1\r\n2051,中国全科医学,\"Chinese General Practice, the medical journal publishing this information\"\"\",1\r\n3072,SCORE CARDIOVASCULAR RISK SCALE,\"A risk assessment tool proposed by European dyslipidemia treatment guidelines for evaluating cardiovascular disease risk\"\"\",1\r\n3073,CANADIAN CARDIOVASCULAR LIFE EXPECTANCY MODEL,\"A model used internationally for cardiovascular disease risk assessment\"\"\",1\r\n3074,CORONARY ARTERY CALCIUM SCORE,\"A scoring system used in cardiovascular disease risk assessment\"\"\",1\r\n3075,US POOLED COHORT EQUATIONS,\"A risk assessment tool used internationally for cardiovascular disease risk evaluation\"\"\",1\r\n3077,LDL?C,\"Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a primary biomarker and intervention target for lipid management\",1\r\n2037,PCI,Percutaneous coronary intervention is a minimally invasive procedure to treat coronary artery disease,1\r\n841,HDL-C,\"**HDL-C (High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol)** is a lipid parameter commonly referred to as \"\"good cholesterol\"\" due to its protective role in cardiovascular health. It functions by helping to remove other forms of cholesterol, such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL), from the bloodstream and arteries, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. HDL-C is routinely monitored as an important biomarker for assessing cardiovascular risk, particularly in hypertensive patients, where it may serve as an indicator of potential health complications. While it is generally associated with positive effects on heart health, its levels can also be evaluated as part of broader risk factor analyses. Overall, HDL-C plays a critical role in maintaining cardiovascular health by facilitating cholesterol clearance and mitigating arterial plaque buildup.\",5\r\n1342,TG,\"**Triglycerides (TG)** are a type of fat found in the blood, measured as a key biomarker for assessing metabolic and cardiovascular health. Elevated TG levels (≥1.7 mmol/L) are a diagnostic criterion for dyslipidemia and serve as a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). They are also monitored in diabetes management alongside other lipid parameters such as LDL-C and non-HDL-C.  \n\nTG elevation is often linked to an unhealthy lifestyle, including poor diet and lack of exercise, but can be managed through lifestyle modifications such as dietary control and increased physical activity. In some cases, medication, including statin drugs, may be prescribed to help reduce elevated triglyceride levels.  \n\nOverall, triglycerides play a significant role in evaluating metabolic disorders, cardiovascular risk, and diabetes-related complications, making them an important parameter in clinical diagnostics and preventive care.\",5\r\n839,TC,\"**Summary of TC (Total Cholesterol):**  \n\nTC refers to Total Cholesterol, a key measure used in assessing lipid levels in the blood. It is an important biomarker for evaluating cardiovascular health, particularly as a risk factor in hypertensive patients. As a lipid parameter, TC is routinely monitored in clinical settings to assess an individual's risk of cardiovascular diseases. Elevated levels of TC are often associated with an increased likelihood of developing heart-related conditions, making it a critical component of lipid profiling and preventive healthcare.  \n\nThe term \"\"TC\"\" consistently denotes Total Cholesterol across all descriptions, emphasizing its role in cardiovascular risk assessment. While the phrasing varies slightly—such as \"\"lipid levels in the blood\"\" versus \"\"cardiovascular risk factor\"\"—the underlying meaning remains the same: TC is a standardized metric for evaluating cholesterol-related health risks. No contradictions exist among the provided descriptions, as they collectively reinforce TC's significance in medical diagnostics and preventive care.  \n\nIn summary, TC (Total Cholesterol) is a well-established clinical measurement used to gauge lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk, particularly in populations with conditions like hypertension. Its consistent definition and application underscore its importance in both routine health screenings and specialized medical evaluations.\",4\r\n2046,匹伐他汀,\"**匹伐他汀 (Pitavastatin)** is a statin drug primarily used for cholesterol management. Classified as a medium-intensity statin, it works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol production in the liver. Pitavastatin is prescribed to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Its efficacy and safety profile make it a viable option for patients requiring moderate lipid-lowering therapy. The drug is available in oral form and is typically administered once daily, often as part of a broader treatment plan that includes dietary and lifestyle modifications.\",2\r\n2050,PCSK9抑制剂,\"PCSK9抑制剂（PCSK9 inhibitors）是一类用于降胆固醇的药物，通常作为联合疗法的一部分。这类药物通过抑制前蛋白转化酶枯草溶菌素9（PCSK9）的活性，从而降低低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL-C）水平，适用于高胆固醇血症和心血管疾病的治疗。  \n\n目前已获批的PCSK9抑制剂包括单克隆抗体类药物，如依洛尤单抗（Evolocumab）和阿利西尤单抗（Alirocumab），以及托莱西单抗（Tocilizumab，注：此处可能存在名称混淆，托莱西单抗通常指IL-6受体拮抗剂，而非PCSK9抑制剂）。此外，小干扰RNA药物英克司兰（Inclisiran）也属于PCSK9靶向疗法，通过RNA干扰机制长效抑制PCSK9的合成，实现持久的降脂效果。  \n\nPCSK9抑制剂因其高效性和良好的安全性，成为他汀类药物不耐受或疗效不足患者的重要选择。未来，随着更多临床研究的开展，这类药物可能在心血管疾病预防和治疗中发挥更广泛的作用。  \n\n（注：若“托莱西单抗”确为PCSK9抑制剂，需核实正确名称；目前已知的PCSK9单抗主要为依洛尤单抗和阿利西尤单抗。）\",1\r\n3083,SMALL INTERFERING RNA DRUGS,Small interfering RNA drugs are a newer class of medications that target specific genes to lower cholesterol levels>,1\r\n2056,海博麦布,海博麦布（HaiBo MaiBu）是一种国产自主研发的胆固醇吸收抑制剂，其作用机制与依折麦布（ezetimibe）相似。该药物为口服用药，常规用法为每日一次，每次10 mg。海博麦布通过抑制肠道内胆固醇的吸收，有效降低血液中的胆固醇水平，适用于高胆固醇血症等脂质代谢异常疾病的治疗。作为国内开发的药物，海博麦布为患者提供了更多治疗选择，并展现了国产创新药物在心血管疾病领域的发展潜力。,3\r\n996,阿托伐他汀,\"**阿托伐他汀（Atorvastatin）**，商品名立普妥（Lipitor），是一种高强度的他汀类药物，主要用于胆固醇管理及血脂调节。其剂量范围为10-80毫克，常见推荐剂量为10毫克，每晚一次。该药物适用于治疗高胆固醇血症或以胆固醇升高为主的混合型高脂血症，同时也用于高血压合并高血脂患者的治疗。临床观察显示，其疗效与其他他汀类药物相似。  \n\n阿托伐他汀的药代动力学可能受食物影响，尤其是葡萄柚汁会显著增加其血药浓度-时间曲线下面积（AUC），可能导致不良反应风险升高，因此建议避免同时摄入。  \n\n综上，阿托伐他汀是一种广泛应用于心血管疾病管理的他汀类药物，兼具降脂和辅助降压作用，但需注意药物相互作用以确保安全使用。\",14\r\n995,银丹心脑通软胶囊,银丹心脑通软胶囊是一种用于治疗高血压合并高血脂的药物,2\r\n2038,PCSK9 INHIBITOR,\"**PCSK9 Inhibitor**  \n\nPCSK9 inhibitors are a class of drugs primarily used to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in the blood. They achieve this by increasing the removal of LDL from the bloodstream, targeting the PCSK9 protein, which regulates LDL receptor degradation. These inhibitors are particularly effective in high-risk patients, such as those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), where aggressive LDL-C reduction is critical.  \n\nPCSK9 inhibitors are often prescribed in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies, such as statins, to enhance their efficacy, especially in cases of mixed hyperlipidemia or when statin therapy alone is insufficient. Their use is well-established in managing high-risk patients who require additional LDL-C reduction beyond what traditional therapies provide.  \n\nWhile the descriptions vary slightly in phrasing, they consistently emphasize the role of PCSK9 inhibitors in lowering LDL-C, their application in high-risk populations, and their frequent use alongside other treatments like statins. There are no significant contradictions in the provided descriptions, only complementary details reinforcing their therapeutic purpose and target patient groups.  \n\nIn summary, PCSK9 inhibitors are a specialized class of drugs designed to significantly reduce LDL-C levels, particularly in high-risk cardiovascular patients, often in combination with other lipid-modifying therapies for optimal outcomes.\",2\r\n1001,刘文立,刘文立是《深圳中西医结合杂志》期刊中关于阿托伐他汀在高血压合并高血脂治疗中的应用效果研究的作者,1\r\n992,杨品,杨品是《现代诊断与治疗》期刊中关于银丹心脑通软胶囊联合不同剂量阿托伐他汀研究的作者，并在相关参考文献中被提及，表明其参与了该项研究。作为该研究的贡献者之一，杨品可能在该课题的实验设计、数据分析或论文撰写等方面发挥了作用。其名字出现在期刊文献及参考文献中，进一步证实了其与该研究的关联性。目前公开信息未显示杨品在其他研究中的参与情况，但其在上述研究中的学术贡献已被记录。,2\r\n3067,APOA,Apolipoprotein A gene involved in lipid metabolism,4\r\n1343,APOB,\"**APOB (Apolipoprotein B)** is a protein encoded by the *APOB* gene, playing a critical role in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health. It is a primary component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), which are essential for transporting cholesterol and triglycerides in the bloodstream. Due to its involvement in lipid metabolism, APOB is a key biomarker for assessing cardiovascular disease risk, as elevated levels are associated with atherosclerosis and other lipid-related disorders. The *APOB* gene's function underscores its importance in maintaining lipid homeostasis and its potential implications in metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.  \n\nThis consolidated description integrates both the protein's functional role in lipid metabolism and its genetic basis, providing a coherent overview of APOB's significance in health and disease.\",8\r\n1344,LP(A),\"**Summary of LP(A):**  \n\nLP(A), or Lipoprotein(a), is a lipoprotein structurally similar to LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Elevated levels of LP(A) are recognized as an independent genetic risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and other cardiovascular conditions. Unlike other lipoproteins, LP(A)'s association with cardiovascular risk is largely determined by genetics, making it a significant biomarker for assessing inherited predisposition to heart disease.  \n\nResearch indicates that high LP(A) levels contribute to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing the likelihood of heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral artery disease. Due to its genetic basis, LP(A) levels remain relatively stable throughout a person’s life and are not easily influenced by lifestyle changes, unlike LDL-C. This underscores the importance of screening for LP(A) in individuals with a family history of premature cardiovascular disease.  \n\nIn summary, LP(A) is a unique, genetically influenced lipoprotein that independently elevates cardiovascular risk, warranting clinical attention for early detection and risk stratification.\",3\r\n3320,环孢素,\"**环孢素（Cyclosporine）**是一种免疫抑制剂，具有多重药物相互作用机制，主要通过抑制有机阴离子转运多肽1B1（OATP1B1）、细胞色素P450 3A4（CYP3A4）和P-糖蛋白（P-gp）等途径影响其他药物的代谢和分布。  \n\n环孢素对OATP1B1的抑制作用尤为显著，可减少肝细胞对他汀类药物（如辛伐他汀、瑞舒伐他汀、阿托伐他汀）的摄取，导致其血药浓度升高，从而增加肌肉毒性风险，包括横纹肌溶解症。此外，环孢素还可能增强他汀类药物的肝脏毒性。  \n\n环孢素对CYP3A4和P-gp的抑制进一步影响药物代谢，尤其是经这些途径清除的药物（如阿托伐他汀），使其血药浓度显著提高。因此，当环孢素与他汀类药物合用时，需密切监测不良反应，必要时调整剂量或选择替代药物以避免严重毒性风险。  \n\n综上，环孢素作为一种强效OATP1B1、CYP3A4和P-gp抑制剂，与他汀类药物的联用需谨慎，以减少肌肉和肝脏毒性的潜在风险。\",6\r\n1361,瑞舒伐他汀,\"**瑞舒伐他汀（Rosuvastatin）** 是一种他汀类药物，主要用于治疗动脉粥样硬化（atherosclerosis），其疗效在ASTEROID研究中得到验证。与其他他汀类药物相比，瑞舒伐他汀的代谢程度较低，但它的药代动力学特性可能受到药物相互作用的影响，尤其是与OATP1B1抑制剂（如环孢素）合用时。  \n\n研究表明，当瑞舒伐他汀与环孢素联合使用时，其血药浓度-时间曲线下面积（AUC）和峰值浓度（Cmax）会显著增加，这主要是由于环孢素抑制了OATP1B1介导的瑞舒伐他汀转运。这种相互作用可能导致药物在体内的暴露量升高，进而增加肌肉毒性（如横纹肌溶解症）和肝脏毒性的风险。因此，临床使用时应谨慎评估联合用药的必要性，并密切监测患者的不良反应。  \n\n综上所述，瑞舒伐他汀是一种高效且代谢较少的他汀类药物，但其与环孢素等OATP1B1抑制剂的相互作用可能带来严重风险，需在医生指导下合理使用。\",5\r\n1407,NON HDL-C,\"Non HDL-C is a secondary lipid control target for patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia, with specific target values based on patient risk levels\",2\r\n3066,LDL?R,Low-density lipoprotein receptor gene involved in lipid metabolism and associated with hyperlipidemia risk,6\r\n3069,APOE,Apolipoprotein E gene involved in lipid metabolism,4\r\n1358,SPC,\"**Summary of SPC (Single-Pill Combination):**  \n\nSPC, or single-pill combination, is a fixed-dose formulation that combines multiple medications into a single pill, primarily used to treat conditions such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia.

By lowering LDL-C through lifestyle modifications or pharmacotherapy, clinicians can significantly mitigate ASCVD risk.  \n\nIn summary, LDL-C is integral to ASCVD risk evaluation, target setting, and intervention, underscoring its central role in cardiovascular disease prevention and management.\",48\r\n939,ASCVD,RASI,RASI is recommended for patients with hypertension and high risk of ASCVD due to its effects on the renin-angiotensin system,29\r\n993,ASCVD,DYSLIPIDEMIA,Dyslipidemia is a risk factor for ASCVD,29\r\n2451,中国血脂管理指南（2023 年）,ASCVD,The guidelines provide risk stratification and treatment protocols for ASCVD prevention,29\r\n1329,ASCVD,血脂水平分层,ASCVD is related to cholesterol level stratification in clinical classification,28\r\n1347,ASCVD,CABG,CABG is a treatment for severe ASCVD cases,28\r\n1350,ASCVD,CHINESE ADULTS,Chinese adults are the primary group for whom ASCVD risk assessment and management strategies are designed.,28\r\n1358,ASCVD,中国全科医学,Chinese General Practice published these ASCVD treatment guidelines,28\r\n2446,ASCVD,SCORE CARDIOVASCULAR RISK SCALE,ASCVD risk can be assessed using the SCORE cardiovascular risk scale,28\r\n2447,ASCVD,CANADIAN CARDIOVASCULAR LIFE EXPECTANCY MODEL,ASCVD risk can be assessed using the Canadian cardiovascular life expectancy model,28\r\n2448,ASCVD,CORONARY ARTERY CALCIUM SCORE,ASCVD risk can be assessed using the coronary artery calcium score,28\r\n2449,ASCVD,US POOLED COHORT EQUATIONS,ASCVD risk can be assessed using the US pooled cohort equations,28\r\n2452,ASCVD,LDL?C,LDL-C is the primary biochemical marker and therapeutic target for ASCVD risk reduction,28\r\n2453,PCI,ASCVD,PCI is a treatment for ASCVD,28\r\n532,LDL-C,HDL-C,\"**LDL-C and HDL-C** are both cholesterol markers used in cardiovascular risk assessment, but they play opposing roles in cardiovascular health. **LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol)**, often referred to as \"\"bad\"\" cholesterol, contributes to the buildup of plaque in arteries, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, **HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol)**, known as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol, helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream, transporting it to the liver for excretion, thereby reducing cardiovascular risk.  \n\nThese two lipid markers are routinely measured together to provide a comprehensive evaluation of an individual's lipid profile and overall cardiovascular health. While **LDL-C** is associated with higher cardiovascular risk when elevated, **HDL-C** is considered protective, with higher levels generally linked to better outcomes. Their opposing functions make them critical in assessing and managing heart disease risk, guiding interventions such as lifestyle changes or medication to optimize cholesterol levels.  \n\nIn summary, **LDL-C and HDL-C** serve as key indicators in cardiovascular risk assessment, with **LDL-C** promoting harmful plaque formation and **HDL-C** offering protective benefits by aiding cholesterol clearance. Monitoring both markers allows for a balanced understanding of an individual's lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health.\",26\r\n1354,TG,LDL-C,Both TG and LDL-C are lipid parameters monitored and managed in lipid-lowering treatment,26\r\n926,TC,LDL-C,\"**Summary of TC and LDL-C:**  \n\nTC (Total Cholesterol) and LDL-C (Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol) are both measures of cholesterol levels in the blood and are key lipid parameters used in cardiovascular risk assessment. TC represents the total amount of cholesterol present in the bloodstream, including LDL-C, HDL-C (High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol), and other lipid components. LDL-C, often referred to as \"\"bad cholesterol,\"\" is a specific subset of cholesterol that contributes to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.  \n\nBoth TC and LDL-C are routinely monitored in clinical settings to evaluate an individual's lipid profile and assess their risk for conditions such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke. Elevated levels of either parameter may indicate a higher risk of cardiovascular complications, though LDL-C is often prioritized in treatment guidelines due to its direct association with arterial plaque formation. Together, these measurements provide a comprehensive view of an individual's cholesterol metabolism and overall cardiovascular health.\",25\r\n2469,LDL-C,匹伐他汀,Pitavastatin is a statin that lowers LDL-C levels,23\r\n1362,LDL-C,PCSK9抑制剂,PCSK9 inhibitors are used when statins alone cannot achieve LDL-C targets,22\r\n2464,LDL-C,SMALL INTERFERING RNA DRUGS,Small interfering RNA drugs are used in combination with statins to further reduce LDL-C levels,22\r\n2477,海博麦布,阿托伐他汀,HaiBo MaiBu can be combined with statins like atorvastatin for enhanced LDL-C reduction,17\r\n648,银丹心脑通软胶囊,阿托伐他汀,银丹心脑通软胶囊联合不同剂量阿托伐他汀用于治疗高血压合并高血脂,16\r\n2498,PCSK9 INHIBITOR,STATINS,Statins and PCSK9 inhibitors are often combined to achieve LDL-C targets in mixed hyperlipidemia,16\r\n650,阿托伐他汀,刘文立,刘文立研究了阿托伐他汀在高血压合并高血脂治疗中的应用效果,15\r\n647,阿托伐他汀钙,杨品,杨品可能参与了阿托伐他汀钙的相关研究,14\r\n2439,APOA,APOB,Both are apolipoprotein genes involved in lipid metabolism,12\r\n928,APOB,LP(A),ApoB and Lp(a) are both involved in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk assessment,11\r\n2695,环孢素,瑞舒伐他汀,环孢素作为OATP1B1抑制剂，与瑞舒伐他汀合用可能增加横纹肌溶解症的风险,11\r\n2733,瑞舒伐他汀,环孢素,\"瑞舒伐他汀（rosuvastatin）与环孢素（cyclosporine）之间存在显著的药物相互作用。环孢素通过抑制肝脏转运蛋白OATP1B1，显著增加瑞舒伐他汀在血液中的浓度。这一相互作用导致瑞舒伐他汀的药代动力学参数发生变化，具体表现为其血药浓度-时间曲线下面积（AUC）和峰值浓度（Cmax）的升高。由于瑞舒伐他汀的治疗窗较窄，这种浓度的增加可能提高其不良反应的风险，包括肌肉毒性（如肌病或横纹肌溶解）和肝脏毒性。因此，当瑞舒伐他汀与环孢素联合使用时，需密切监测患者的不良反应，并考虑调整瑞舒伐他汀的剂量以降低潜在风险。  \n\n（注：总结已整合两项描述，统一了机制与临床影响，并保持第三人称客观表述，字数控制在500字内。）\",11\r\n636,HDL-C,高血脂,HDL-C levels are inversely related to hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular risk,10\r\n996,NON HDL-C,APOB,ApoB is a better predictor of ASCVD risk compared to non HDL-C,10\r\n2433,LDL?R,APOA,Both genes are involved in lipid metabolism and contribute to hyperlipidemia risk,10\r\n2436,LDL?R,APOE,Both genes are involved in lipid metabolism and contribute to hyperlipidemia risk,10\r\n944,SPC,瑞舒伐他汀,SPC and rosuvastatin are both used for lipid-lowering and cardiovascular protection,8\r\n2438,LDL?R,VLDL,\"LDL?R expression is inhibited by insulin resistance, which also increases VLDL generation\",8\r\n2444,APOC,APOE,Both are apolipoprotein genes involved in lipid metabolism,8\r\n1352,CHINESE GENERAL PRACTICE,TG,Chinese General Practice provides guidelines on managing TG levels,7\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
