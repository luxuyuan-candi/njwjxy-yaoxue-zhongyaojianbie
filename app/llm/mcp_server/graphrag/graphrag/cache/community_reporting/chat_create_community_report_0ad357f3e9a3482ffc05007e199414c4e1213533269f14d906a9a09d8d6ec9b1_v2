It is a significant focus of research and clinical practice, particularly in geriatrics, as evidenced by studies published in *Geriatrics* (2008) that explore its causes, assessment, treatment, and management.  \n\nThe condition is also the namesake of the journal *Dysphagia*, which publishes research on swallowing disorders, including systematic reviews on therapeutic interventions. One such review examined the effects of therapy for oropharyngeal dysphagia administered by speech and language therapists.  \n\nPost-stroke dysphagia is a common manifestation of the disorder, often requiring diagnostic assessments such as Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study (VFSS) or Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). Management typically involves a combination of compensatory strategies, rehabilitative exercises, and dietary modifications tailored to the patient's needs.  \n\nIn summary, DYSPHAGIA encompasses both a clinical condition affecting swallowing function and an academic journal dedicated to advancing research in the field. It is widely studied in geriatric and post-stroke populations, with diagnostic tools like VFSS and FEES guiding evidence-based therapeutic approaches.\",13\r\n5473,PEG,\"Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) is an effective method for long-term enteral nutrition (>4 weeks) in patients with severe dysphagia, reducing complications compared to nasogastric tubes\",5\r\n5475,TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION,\"A therapeutic intervention for dysphagia that may improve swallowing function, though further research is needed\",1\r\n5476,PERCUTANEOUS PHARYNGEAL ELECTRICAL STIMULATION,A treatment method that shortens pharyngeal transit time in patients with dysphagia,1\r\n5478,NASOINTESTINAL TUBE,An alternative enteral nutrition method for patients with severe dysphagia and high aspiration risk,1\r\n5690,SPEYER R,\"Speyer R is one of the authors of a systematic review on the effects of therapy in oropharyngeal dysphagia by speech and language therapists published in Dysphagia, 2010\"\"\",1\r\n5691,BAIJENS L,\"Baijens L is one of the authors of a systematic review on the effects of therapy in oropharyngeal dysphagia by speech and language therapists published in Dysphagia, 2010\"\"\",1\r\n5692,HEIJNEN M,\"Heijnen M is one of the authors of a systematic review on the effects of therapy in oropharyngeal dysphagia by speech and language therapists published in Dysphagia, 2010\"\"\",1\r\n5711,OROPHARYNGEAL DYSPHAGIA,\"Oropharyngeal dysphagia is a condition where effects of therapy by speech and language therapists were systematically reviewed in Dysphagia, 2010\"\"\",1\r\n5477,NASOGASTRIC TUBE,\"A short-term enteral nutrition method for stroke patients with dysphagia, though it may interfere with swallowing recovery\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n5966,DYSPHAGIA,STROKE,\"Stroke frequently causes dysphagia as a complication, requiring specialized assessment and treatment\",75\r\n5964,PEG,DYSPHAGIA,PEG is recommended for long-term nutrition management in severe dysphagia cases,18\r\n5967,DYSPHAGIA,TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION,Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is a potential treatment for dysphagia,14\r\n5968,DYSPHAGIA,PERCUTANEOUS PHARYNGEAL ELECTRICAL STIMULATION,Pharyngeal electrical stimulation can improve swallowing function in dysphagia patients,14\r\n5970,DYSPHAGIA,NASOINTESTINAL TUBE,Nasointestinal tubes are preferred for patients with high aspiration risk,14\r\n6202,SPEYER R,DYSPHAGIA,Speyer R is one of the authors of a study published in Dysphagia,14\r\n6203,BAIJENS L,DYSPHAGIA,Baijens L is one of the authors of a study published in Dysphagia,14\r\n6204,HEIJNEN M,DYSPHAGIA,Heijnen M is one of the authors of a study published in Dysphagia,14\r\n6205,DYSPHAGIA,OROPHARYNGEAL DYSPHAGIA,Oropharyngeal dysphagia was systematically reviewed in Dysphagia journal,14\r\n5965,PEG,NASOGASTRIC TUBE,PEG is preferred over nasogastric tubes for long-term enteral nutrition due to lower complication rates,7\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
