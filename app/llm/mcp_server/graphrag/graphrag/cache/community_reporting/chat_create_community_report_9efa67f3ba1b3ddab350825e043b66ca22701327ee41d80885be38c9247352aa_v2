CKD is a significant comorbidity that exacerbates cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients and is commonly observed in individuals with peripheral artery disease (PAD) or diabetes. It influences blood pressure management, often necessitating stricter control (e.g., targets below 130/80 mmHg if tolerated). CKD also requires careful monitoring when using angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) due to potential effects on potassium and creatinine levels. Additionally, CKD stages 3-4 are considered high-risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). The condition is frequently mentioned as a complication in hypertension management and may impact blood pressure targets in patients with other comorbidities, such as tumors.
