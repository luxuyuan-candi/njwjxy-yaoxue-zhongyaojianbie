It is classified as a crystal-related arthropathy caused by disruptions in purine metabolism and/or impaired uric acid excretion, leading to chronic high serum uric acid levels.  \n\nThe condition typically manifests as sudden, severe joint inflammation, with symptoms including redness, swelling, and intense pain, commonly affecting lower-extremity joints such as the first metatarsophalangeal joint (big toe), ankles, knees, and heels. Acute attacks often resolve within days to two weeks but may recur, especially when triggered by factors like alcohol consumption, high-purine diets, cold exposure, or strenuous exercise. Over time, untreated gout can lead to chronic joint damage and atypical symptoms. Severe episodes may also present with systemic symptoms like fever, chills, fatigue, and palpitations.  \n\nGout is associated with multiple comorbidities, including metabolic syndrome components such as hyperlipidemia (elevated cholesterol and triglycerides), hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease. Some patients may develop kidney complications due to urate crystal deposition or impaired renal function. Management focuses on lowering uric acid levels through pharmacological therapy (e.g., urate-lowering drugs) and lifestyle modifications to prevent recurrent attacks and long-term damage.  \n\nGlobally, gout prevalence varies by region, influenced by dietary habits, genetic factors, and healthcare access. While primarily a joint disease, its systemic metabolic implications underscore the need for comprehensive treatment addressing both acute symptoms and underlying hyperuricemia.\",33\r\n246,高尿酸血症,\"高尿酸血症（Hyperuricemia）是一种以血液中尿酸水平升高为特征的代谢性疾病，主要由嘌呤代谢紊乱和/或尿酸排泄减少所致。作为痛风的主要病因，高尿酸血症可引发关节炎症、尿酸结晶沉积（如痛风石）及其他并发症，如肾结石或慢性肾病。  \n\n流行病学数据显示，高尿酸血症在中国的患病率较高且存在性别与年龄差异。根据2018年中国慢性病及危险因素监测数据，成人患病率为14.0%，其中男性（24.5%）显著高于女性（3.6%）。青年男性（18~29岁）患病率尤为突出，达32.3%，提示该群体可能受饮食、遗传或代谢因素影响较大。  \n\n此外，高尿酸血症常与其他代谢异常共存，例如高脂血症，二者可能相互加剧，增加心血管疾病风险。这一关联强调了综合管理代谢紊乱的重要性，需通过生活方式干预（如低嘌呤饮食、控制酒精摄入）及药物治疗（如尿酸合成抑制剂或促排泄剂）来降低尿酸水平并预防并发症。  \n\n综上，高尿酸血症是一种需长期关注的慢性病，其防治需结合个体化策略与公共卫生措施，以减轻疾病负担。\",4\r\n316,RDEA594,\"Lesinurad is a novel urate-lowering drug that inhibits renal urate transporters, not yet available in China\"\"\",2\r\n302,尿酸性肾石症,\"尿酸性肾石症 (Uric acid nephrolithiasis) is a type of kidney stone condition characterized by the formation of stones due to elevated levels of uric acid in the urine. This condition is often associated with gout and hyperuricemia, which contribute to the excessive accumulation of uric acid in the body. The stones develop when uric acid crystallizes in the kidneys, leading to obstruction, pain, and potential complications if untreated. Both descriptions emphasize the role of high uric acid levels as the primary cause, linking the condition to metabolic disorders such as gout. The term \"\"尿酸性肾石症\"\" is the Chinese equivalent of \"\"uric acid nephrolithiasis,\"\" further clarifying its definition in a multilingual context. The summary consolidates these perspectives into a coherent explanation, highlighting the condition's etiology and clinical associations.\",2\r\n255,急性尿酸性肾病,\"急性尿酸性肾病是由于血和尿中尿酸浓度急剧上升，大量尿酸沉积并堵塞于肾小管、集合管等处，导致急性尿路梗阻。临床表现为急性少尿、无尿，急性肾衰竭，尿中可见大量尿酸。\"\"\",1\r\n271,第一跖趾关节,,1\r\n257,足背,\"足背是痛风好发的下肢关节部位之一\"\"\",1\r\n258,足跟,\"足跟是痛风好发的下肢关节部位之一\"\"\",1\r\n259,踝关节,\"踝关节是痛风好发的下肢关节部位之一\"\"\",1\r\n260,膝关节,\"膝关节是痛风好发的下肢关节部位之一\"\"\",1\r\n261,指关节,\"指关节是痛风可能累及的上肢关节部位\"\"\",1\r\n262,肘关节,\"肘关节是痛风可能累及的上肢关节部位\"\"\",1\r\n263,腕关节,\"腕关节是痛风可能累及的上肢关节部位\"\"\",1\r\n264,骶髂关节,\"随着病程进展，痛风可能累及骶髂关节\"\"\",1\r\n265,肩关节,\"随着病程进展，痛风可能累及肩关节\"\"\",1\r\n266,脊柱关节,\"随着病程进展，痛风可能累及脊柱关节\"\"\",1\r\n293,痛风性关节炎,\"A specific manifestation of gout involving joint inflammation caused by urate crystal deposition\"\"\",1\r\n294,双能 CT,\"A diagnostic imaging technique with 84% sensitivity and 93% specificity for detecting urate crystals in gout\"\"\",1\r\n295,关节腔穿刺,\"A diagnostic procedure involving joint fluid extraction to identify monosodium urate crystals for gout confirmation\"\"\",1\r\n296,痛风石抽吸,\"A diagnostic procedure involving tophus aspiration to identify urate crystals for gout diagnosis\"\"\",1\r\n303,慢性肾脏病,\"慢性肾脏病 (CKD) is a long-term condition where kidney function is progressively impaired, often associated with gout and hyperuricemia\",1\r\n320,非甾体抗炎药,\"**Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs, 非甾体抗炎药)** are a class of medications widely used for their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. They include common drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, aspirin, and celecoxib. NSAIDs serve as a first-line treatment for acute conditions like migraines, musculoskeletal pain, and gout attacks.  \n\nIn the context of **gout**, NSAIDs are frequently prescribed when colchicine is contraindicated or ineffective. They are particularly useful for managing acute gout flare-ups, with both non-selective COX inhibitors (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) and selective COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) being commonly employed. However, their use requires caution due to potential **gastrointestinal risks** (e.g., ulcers, bleeding) and **cardiovascular risks** (e.g., increased blood pressure, heart attack risk), especially with long-term or high-dose use.  \n\nFor **acute pain management**, NSAIDs are often the preferred choice due to their rapid onset of action and effectiveness in reducing inflammation. Drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen, and diclofenac are frequently used to alleviate pain from conditions such as headaches, sprains, and arthritis.  \n\nIn summary, NSAIDs (非甾体抗炎药) are versatile medications essential for treating acute pain, inflammation, and gout, but their use must be carefully monitored to mitigate adverse effects, particularly in patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal or cardiovascular conditions.\",15\r\n321,糖皮质激素,\"糖皮质激素（如泼尼松）是一类抗炎药物，主要用于治疗急性痛风发作伴全身症状或其他药物无效的情况，推荐短期使用以降低风险。此外，它们也被用于预防痛风发作。然而，这类药物存在多种副作用，包括高血糖、骨质疏松和高血压等。因此，临床使用时需权衡疗效与潜在风险，并密切监测患者健康状况。  \n\n糖皮质激素的作用机制涉及抑制炎症反应，从而缓解痛风症状，但其长期使用可能导致代谢紊乱和骨骼问题。短期应用时，其抗炎效果显著，但需注意个体差异及合并症（如糖尿病或心血管疾病）的影响。综合来看，糖皮质激素是痛风治疗中的重要选项，但需严格遵循短期、低剂量的原则，并配合其他管理措施以减少副作用风险。\",9\r\n340,痛风急性发作,\"Recurrent inflammatory episodes during urate-lowering therapy, preventable with colchicine or NSAIDs.\"\"\",5\r\n331,双氯芬酸,\"**双氯芬酸 (Diclofenac)** is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) primarily used to treat pain and inflammatory conditions. It functions as a non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, effectively reducing inflammation and alleviating pain. While some descriptions indicate it is available over-the-counter, its regulatory status may vary by region.  \n\nDiclofenac is commonly prescribed for acute pain management, with a typical dosage of 50 mg administered three times daily due to its relatively short half-life of approximately two hours. This pharmacokinetic profile makes it suitable for short-term use in conditions requiring rapid pain relief.  \n\nAs an NSAID, diclofenac shares therapeutic properties with other drugs in its class, such as anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects. However, its accessibility (prescription vs. over-the-counter) and specific dosing regimens should be confirmed based on local medical guidelines. Overall, diclofenac is a widely used medication for managing pain and inflammation, with its usage tailored to individual patient needs and regional regulations.\",2\r\n883,肌肉骨骼疼痛,\"Chronic pain condition affecting muscles, bones, joints, tendons or soft tissues, often managed with NSAIDs and physical therapy>\",2\r\n346,胃肠道出血,\"A serious adverse effect linked to NSAID use.\"\"\",1\r\n335,酮洛芬,\"**Ketoprofen (酮洛芬)** is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for managing musculoskeletal pain and acute inflammation. It is available in both topical and oral formulations, with the topical form specifically targeting localized pain relief. When administered orally, it is typically prescribed at a dosage of 50 mg three times daily due to its very short half-life of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours. This rapid metabolism necessitates frequent dosing to maintain therapeutic effects.  \n\nAs an NSAID, ketoprofen works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin production and alleviating pain and inflammation. Its short half-life makes it particularly suitable for acute conditions rather than chronic use. The topical formulation offers a targeted approach with potentially fewer systemic side effects compared to oral administration.  \n\nIn summary, ketoprofen is a versatile NSAID with applications in both localized and systemic pain management, characterized by its short duration of action and effectiveness in treating acute inflammatory conditions.\",1\r\n304,降尿酸治疗,\"降尿酸治疗（Urate-lowering therapy, ULT）是一种针对痛风患者的治疗方法，旨在通过降低血液中的尿酸水平来管理和预防痛风发作。该治疗的主要目标是将血尿酸浓度维持在特定范围内（通常低于6 mg/dL或360 μmol/L），以减少尿酸结晶沉积并防止疾病进展。  \n\n降尿酸治疗在初期阶段可能引发痛风急性发作，这是由于尿酸水平的快速波动导致已沉积的尿酸盐结晶释放，从而触发炎症反应。因此，临床实践中常建议在降尿酸治疗开始时配合使用抗炎药物（如非甾体抗炎药或秋水仙碱）以预防或缓解初期痛风发作。  \n\n该疗法适用于慢性痛风患者、频繁发作的痛风患者，或存在痛风石、关节损伤等并发症的患者。常见的降尿酸药物包括别嘌呤醇（Allopurinol）、非布司他（Febuxostat）和促尿酸排泄药（如苯溴马隆）。治疗方案需根据患者的肾功能、药物耐受性及个体反应进行调整，并需长期坚持以达到最佳效果。  \n\n综上，降尿酸治疗是一种关键的风湿病管理手段，尽管初期可能伴随痛风发作风险，但其长期应用能有效控制尿酸水平，减少痛风复发及并发症的发生。\",7\r\n305,别嘌醇,\"别嘌醇是一种用于治疗高尿酸血症的药物，其主要作用机制是通过抑制黄嘌呤氧化酶来减少尿酸的形成，从而有效降低血液中的尿酸水平。作为抑制尿酸合成的药物，别嘌醇在临床中常用于降尿酸治疗，尤其适用于痛风等由高尿酸血症引起的疾病。  \n\n使用别嘌醇时需根据患者的肾功能调整剂量，以确保用药的安全性和有效性。该药物通过精准调控尿酸生成，帮助患者维持正常的尿酸代谢，减少因尿酸沉积引发的并发症。  \n\n综上所述，别嘌醇是一种高效、针对性强的降尿酸药物，适用于高尿酸血症及相关疾病的治疗，但需在医生指导下合理使用，特别是肾功能不全的患者需谨慎调整剂量。\",8\r\n306,非布司他,\"非布司他是一种抑制尿酸合成的药物，用于降尿酸治疗，对轻中度肾功能不全者无需调整剂量\"\"\",7\r\n309,黄嘌呤氧化酶,\"黄嘌呤氧化酶是尿酸合成的关键酶，别嘌醇和非布司他通过抑制其活性来减少尿酸合成\"\"\",4\r\n324,泼尼松,\"**泼尼松**（Prednisone）是一种糖皮质激素，主要用于治疗急性痛风发作以及作为预防痛风的替代疗法。在急性痛风发作时，推荐剂量为0.5 mg·kg⁻¹·d⁻¹，疗程通常为5至10天。此外，当其他痛风预防疗法无效时，泼尼松也可作为替代选择，常用剂量为5至10 mg/天。  \n\n泼尼松通过其抗炎和免疫抑制作用缓解痛风症状，尤其适用于对其他药物（如非甾体抗炎药或秋水仙碱）不耐受或疗效不佳的患者。其在不同临床场景下的剂量和疗程有所差异，但均以短期使用为主，以减少长期糖皮质激素治疗可能带来的副作用。  \n\n综上，泼尼松在痛风治疗中具有双重作用：既可作为急性发作时的短期治疗药物，也可作为预防性治疗的备选方案，具体用法需根据患者病情和个体反应调整。\",2\r\n326,曲安奈德,\"**曲安奈德** (Triamcinolone Acetonide) is a glucocorticoid medication administered via intra-articular (joint) or intramuscular injection to reduce inflammation. It is commonly used to treat conditions such as acute gout attacks, where it helps alleviate pain and swelling by suppressing inflammatory responses.  \n\nAs a potent corticosteroid, 曲安奈德 carries potential risks, including an increased susceptibility to infections, osteoporosis with prolonged use, and other systemic side effects associated with glucocorticoids. Medical professionals exercise caution when prescribing or administering this medication, ensuring that the benefits outweigh the risks for each patient.  \n\nThe descriptions provided align in characterizing 曲安奈德 as an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid used for joint and muscle-related conditions, with an emphasis on its therapeutic application in acute gout. The combined summary integrates its clinical use with necessary precautions regarding adverse effects.\",2\r\n347,骨质疏松,骨质疏松（Osteoporosis）是一种慢性疾病，主要表现为骨密度降低和骨组织微结构退化，从而增加骨折风险。该病症既可能是长期使用糖皮质激素（glucocorticoid therapy）的并发症之一，也被视为威胁中老年人健康的常见慢性病。研究表明，适量运动有助于增加骨密度，改善骨骼健康，进而提升老年人的生活质量。因此，在临床管理中，骨质疏松的防治需结合药物干预（如避免长期过量使用糖皮质激素）和生活方式调整（如规律运动），以降低骨折风险并促进整体健康。,2\r\n343,高血糖,\"**高血糖 (Hyperglycemia)**  \n\n高血糖 refers to elevated blood sugar levels, a condition commonly associated with diabetes and metabolic disorders. It is recognized as one of the \"\"three highs\"\" (alongside hypertension and hyperlipidemia) that contribute to significant health risks, including cardiovascular disease and organ damage. Additionally, 高血糖 can arise as a metabolic side effect of corticosteroid therapy, which may disrupt insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation.  \n\nWhile diabetes is a primary cause of 高血糖, the condition can also occur in non-diabetic individuals due to medications, stress, or other underlying health issues. Managing 高血糖 typically involves lifestyle modifications, medication, and monitoring to prevent complications. The dual association—both as a hallmark of diabetes and a drug-induced side effect—highlights its multifaceted nature in clinical and metabolic contexts.  \n\n(Word count: 120)\",1\r\n341,关节感染,\"A contraindication for corticosteroid injections, requiring exclusion before treatment.\"\"\",1\r\n311,HLA-B*5801基因,\"HLA-B*5801基因阳性是别嘌醇不良反应的危险因素，建议治疗前进行检测\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n197,痛风,高尿酸血症,痛风（Gout）是一种与高尿酸血症（Hyperuricemia）密切相关的疾病，主要由长期的高尿酸血症引发。高尿酸血症是痛风的主要病因，其特征是血液中尿酸水平持续升高，导致尿酸盐结晶在关节及周围组织中沉积，从而引发痛风的急性炎症反应和剧烈疼痛。两者的关系表现为：高尿酸血症为痛风的病理基础，而痛风则是高尿酸血症的常见临床表现之一。这一关联性在医学研究中已得到广泛证实，且中英文描述均强调了高尿酸血症在痛风发病中的核心作用。因此，痛风与高尿酸血症可视为同一病理过程的不同阶段或表现，而非独立的疾病实体。,37\r\n284,RDEA594,痛风,Lesinurad is a novel treatment option for gout patients not responding to standard therapy,35\r\n286,尿酸性肾石症,痛风,Gout patients are at risk for developing uric acid kidney stones,35\r\n205,痛风,急性尿酸性肾病,痛风患者可能因尿酸浓度急剧上升导致急性尿酸性肾病,34\r\n207,痛风,第一跖趾关节,第一跖趾关节是痛风最常见的发作部位,34\r\n208,痛风,足背,足背是痛风好发的下肢关节部位,34\r\n209,痛风,足跟,足跟是痛风好发的下肢关节部位,34\r\n210,痛风,踝关节,踝关节是痛风好发的下肢关节部位,34\r\n211,痛风,膝关节,膝关节是痛风好发的下肢关节部位,34\r\n212,痛风,指关节,指关节是痛风可能累及的上肢关节部位,34\r\n213,痛风,肘关节,肘关节是痛风可能累及的上肢关节部位,34\r\n214,痛风,腕关节,腕关节是痛风可能累及的上肢关节部位,34\r\n215,痛风,骶髂关节,随着病程进展，痛风可能累及骶髂关节,34\r\n216,痛风,肩关节,随着病程进展，痛风可能累及肩关节,34\r\n217,痛风,脊柱关节,随着病程进展，痛风可能累及脊柱关节,34\r\n248,痛风性关节炎,痛风,Gouty arthritis is a specific clinical manifestation of gout,34\r\n249,双能 CT,痛风,Dual-energy CT is a diagnostic tool for detecting urate crystals in gout,34\r\n250,关节腔穿刺,痛风,Joint aspiration is a diagnostic method for gout through crystal identification,34\r\n251,痛风石抽吸,痛风,Tophus aspiration confirms gout diagnosis through urate crystal identification,34\r\n260,痛风,慢性肾脏病,Chronic kidney disease is a common comorbidity in gout patients and can affect uric acid excretion,34\r\n292,非甾体抗炎药,糖皮质激素,糖皮质激素用于非甾体抗炎药无效或使用禁忌的患者。,24\r\n303,痛风急性发作,中华内科杂志,The journal published the 2023 clinical guidelines on gout management referenced in the text.,18\r\n665,非甾体抗炎药,双氯芬酸,Diclofenac is a type of NSAID,17\r\n668,非甾体抗炎药,肌肉骨骼疼痛,NSAIDs are a primary treatment option for musculoskeletal pain,17\r\n300,非甾体抗炎药,胃肠道出血,NSAIDs may cause gastrointestinal bleeding as a severe adverse effect.,16\r\n667,非甾体抗炎药,酮洛芬,Ketoprofen is a type of NSAID,16\r\n263,降尿酸治疗,别嘌醇,别嘌醇是降尿酸治疗的常用药物之一,15\r\n268,别嘌醇,非布司他,别嘌醇和非布司他都是抑制尿酸合成的药物，用于降尿酸治疗,15\r\n269,别嘌醇,黄嘌呤氧化酶,\"别嘌醇是一种药物，其主要作用机制是通过抑制黄嘌呤氧化酶的活性来发挥作用。黄嘌呤氧化酶是一种参与尿酸合成的关键酶，而别嘌醇通过抑制该酶的活性，能够有效减少尿酸的生成。这一机制使得别嘌醇在临床上常用于治疗高尿酸血症及相关疾病，如痛风。通过阻断黄嘌呤氧化酶的催化作用，别嘌醇帮助降低体内尿酸水平，从而缓解症状并预防并发症。  \n\n综上所述，别嘌醇与黄嘌呤氧化酶之间的关系是明确的：别嘌醇作为黄嘌呤氧化酶的抑制剂，通过干扰其活性来调控尿酸合成，发挥治疗作用。\",12\r\n271,非布司他,黄嘌呤氧化酶,非布司他通过抑制黄嘌呤氧化酶活性来减少尿酸合成,11\r\n294,糖皮质激素,泼尼松,泼尼松是糖皮质激素的一种具体药物，用于急性痛风发作的治疗。,11\r\n296,糖皮质激素,曲安奈德,曲安奈德是糖皮质激素的一种具体药物，可用于关节腔内或肌肉注射治疗痛风。,11\r\n307,糖皮质激素,骨质疏松,Prolonged glucocorticoid therapy increases osteoporosis risk.,11\r\n306,糖皮质激素,高血糖,Corticosteroid use is linked to elevated blood sugar levels.,10\r\n308,糖皮质激素,关节感染,Joint infection must be ruled out before corticosteroid injections.,10\r\n270,别嘌醇,HLA-B*5801基因,HLA-B*5801基因阳性患者使用别嘌醇可能增加不良反应风险,9\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
