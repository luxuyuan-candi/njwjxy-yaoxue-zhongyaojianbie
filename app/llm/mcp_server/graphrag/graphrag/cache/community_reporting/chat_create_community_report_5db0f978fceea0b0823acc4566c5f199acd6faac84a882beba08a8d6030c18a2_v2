Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\r\n3319,维拉帕米,\"**维拉帕米（Verapamil）** 是一种药物，具有多种药理作用和潜在的药物相互作用。作为P-糖蛋白（P-gp）抑制剂，维拉帕米能够抑制P-gp的活性，从而增加某些药物（如秋水仙碱）的血药浓度，可能导致毒性风险升高。  \n\n此外，维拉帕米与**美托洛尔**合用时，可能对心脏传导系统和窦房结功能产生协同抑制作用，导致心动过缓、血压下降等不良反应，因此需谨慎监测患者的心率和血压。  \n\n同时，维拉帕米与**辛伐他汀**联合使用时，可能增加肌病（如肌肉疼痛、无力）和横纹肌溶解症的风险，这可能是由于维拉帕米抑制了辛伐他汀的代谢酶（如CYP3A4），使其血药浓度升高所致。  \n\n综上所述，维拉帕米在临床应用中需注意其药物相互作用，尤其是与P-gp底物（如秋水仙碱）、β受体阻滞剂（如美托洛尔）和他汀类药物（如辛伐他汀）的联合使用，以避免潜在的不良反应。\",3\r\n219,秋水仙碱,\"秋水仙碱（Colchicine）是一种口服药物，主要用于预防和治疗痛风。在预防方面，它通常以小剂量（0.5 mg）使用，特别是在患者开始降尿酸治疗的初期阶段，以减少痛风发作的风险。在治疗方面，秋水仙碱对痛风急性发作有效，但建议在症状出现后12小时内开始使用，超过36小时后其疗效可能显著下降。  \n\n使用秋水仙碱时需根据患者的肾功能调整剂量，以避免潜在的毒性反应。常见的不良反应包括胃肠道症状（如恶心、呕吐、腹泻），长期或过量使用可能导致肝、肾损害。因此，临床使用时需严格遵循剂量指导，并监测患者的肝肾功能。  \n\n综合来看，秋水仙碱在痛风的管理中具有双重作用：既可作为急性发作期的治疗药物，也可作为降尿酸治疗初期的预防性用药，但需注意其不良反应和个体化用药原则。\",7\r\n220,非甾体抗炎药,\"**Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs, 非甾体抗炎药)** are a class of medications widely used for their anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. They include common drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, aspirin, and celecoxib. NSAIDs serve as a first-line treatment for acute conditions like migraines, musculoskeletal pain, and gout attacks.  \n\nIn the context of **gout**, NSAIDs are frequently prescribed when colchicine is contraindicated or ineffective. They are particularly useful for managing acute gout flare-ups, with both non-selective COX inhibitors (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) and selective COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) being commonly employed. However, their use requires caution due to potential **gastrointestinal risks** (e.g., ulcers, bleeding) and **cardiovascular risks** (e.g., increased blood pressure, heart attack risk), especially with long-term or high-dose use.  \n\nFor **acute pain management**, NSAIDs are often the preferred choice due to their rapid onset of action and effectiveness in reducing inflammation. Drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen, and diclofenac are frequently used to alleviate pain from conditions such as headaches, sprains, and arthritis.  \n\nIn summary, NSAIDs (非甾体抗炎药) are versatile medications essential for treating acute pain, inflammation, and gout, but their use must be carefully monitored to mitigate adverse effects, particularly in patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal or cardiovascular conditions.\",11\r\n221,糖皮质激素,\"糖皮质激素主要用于急性痛风发作伴全身症状或其他药物无效时，推荐短期使用，需注意高血压等副作用。\"\"\",2\r\n233,酮洛芬,\"**Ketoprofen (酮洛芬)** is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for managing musculoskeletal pain and acute inflammation. It is available in both topical and oral formulations, with the topical form specifically targeting localized pain relief. When administered orally, it is typically prescribed at a dosage of 50 mg three times daily due to its very short half-life of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours. This rapid metabolism necessitates frequent dosing to maintain therapeutic effects.  \n\nAs an NSAID, ketoprofen works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin production and alleviating pain and inflammation. Its short half-life makes it particularly suitable for acute conditions rather than chronic use. The topical formulation offers a targeted approach with potentially fewer systemic side effects compared to oral administration.  \n\nIn summary, ketoprofen is a versatile NSAID with applications in both localized and systemic pain management, characterized by its short duration of action and effectiveness in treating acute inflammatory conditions.\",1\r\n222,IL-1受体拮抗剂,\"IL-1受体拮抗剂可作为二线痛风急性发作期的治疗药物，适用于对一线药物不耐受或有禁忌的患者。\"\"\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2730,辛伐他汀,维拉帕米,维拉帕米显著增加辛伐他汀的AUC和Cmax，可能导致肌肉毒性,28\r\n156,秋水仙碱,非甾体抗炎药,秋水仙碱和非甾体抗炎药均为痛风急性发作的一线治疗药物，可单独或联合使用。,18\r\n159,非甾体抗炎药,糖皮质激素,糖皮质激素用于非甾体抗炎药无效或使用禁忌的患者。,13\r\n370,非甾体抗炎药,酮洛芬,Ketoprofen is a type of NSAID,12\r\n157,秋水仙碱,糖皮质激素,糖皮质激素用于秋水仙碱无效或使用禁忌的患者。,9\r\n158,秋水仙碱,IL-1受体拮抗剂,IL-1受体拮抗剂可作为秋水仙碱不耐受或有禁忌时的二线治疗药物。,9\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
