It functions by helping to remove other forms of cholesterol, such as LDL (low-density lipoprotein), from the bloodstream and arteries, thereby reducing the risk of plaque buildup and cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis (ASCVD).  \n\nWhile HDL-C is generally considered beneficial, it can also serve as a cardiovascular risk factor in certain populations, such as hypertensive patients, where its levels may influence disease progression. Clinically, HDL-C is monitored as part of lipid profiling to assess overall cardiovascular health, with higher levels typically associated with reduced risk. However, its role in ASCVD risk assessment underscores that its impact may vary depending on individual health conditions.  \n\nIn summary, HDL-C is a key biomarker known for its cholesterol-removing properties, often linked to improved heart health, but its interpretation may differ based on specific medical contexts.\",7\r\n1148,TC,\"**Summary of TC (Total Cholesterol):**  \n\nTC, or Total Cholesterol, is a key measure used to assess lipid levels in the blood and plays a significant role in evaluating cardiovascular health. It is a well-established biomarker for cardiovascular risk, particularly in hypertensive patients, and is routinely monitored as part of lipid profiling for cardiovascular risk assessment. Total cholesterol serves as a baseline measurement in the evaluation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, helping clinicians identify individuals who may benefit from lifestyle modifications or medical interventions.  \n\nAs a single, coherent metric, TC provides insight into overall cholesterol levels, encompassing both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, along with other lipid components. Elevated TC levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, making it a critical parameter in preventive healthcare. By integrating TC into broader risk assessment models, medical professionals can better stratify patients and guide treatment decisions to mitigate long-term cardiovascular complications.  \n\nIn summary, TC (Total Cholesterol) is a fundamental lipid parameter used in clinical practice to assess cardiovascular risk, particularly in high-risk populations such as hypertensive patients, and serves as a foundational element in ASCVD risk evaluation.\",4\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n946,LDL-C,HDL-C,\"**LDL-C and HDL-C** are both cholesterol markers used in cardiovascular risk assessment, but they play opposing roles in cardiovascular health. **LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol)**, often referred to as \"\"bad\"\" cholesterol, contributes to the buildup of plaque in arteries, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, **HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol)**, known as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol, helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream, transporting it to the liver for excretion, thereby reducing cardiovascular risk.  \n\nThese two lipid markers are routinely measured together to provide a comprehensive evaluation of an individual's lipid profile and overall cardiovascular health. While **LDL-C** is associated with higher cardiovascular risk when elevated, **HDL-C** is considered protective, with higher levels generally linked to better outcomes. Their opposing functions make them critical in assessing and managing heart disease risk, guiding interventions such as lifestyle changes or medication to optimize cholesterol levels.  \n\nIn summary, **LDL-C and HDL-C** serve as key indicators in cardiovascular risk assessment, with **LDL-C** promoting harmful plaque formation and **HDL-C** offering protective benefits by aiding cholesterol clearance. Monitoring both markers allows for a balanced understanding of an individual's lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health.\",47\r\n1701,TC,LDL-C,\"**Summary of TC and LDL-C:**  \n\nTC (Total Cholesterol) and LDL-C (Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol) are both measures of cholesterol levels in the blood and are key lipid parameters used in cardiovascular risk assessment. TC represents the total amount of cholesterol present in the bloodstream, including LDL-C, HDL-C (High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol), and other lipid components. LDL-C, often referred to as \"\"bad cholesterol,\"\" is a specific subset of cholesterol that contributes to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.  \n\nBoth TC and LDL-C are routinely monitored in clinical settings to evaluate an individual's lipid profile and assess their risk for conditions such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke. Elevated levels of either parameter may indicate a higher risk of cardiovascular complications, though LDL-C is often prioritized in treatment guidelines due to its direct association with arterial plaque formation. Together, these measurements provide a comprehensive view of an individual's cholesterol metabolism and overall cardiovascular health.\",44\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
