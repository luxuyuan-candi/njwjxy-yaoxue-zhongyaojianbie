It is often caused by factors such as hypertension and results from a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain. While the effects of a TIA are short-lived, the condition significantly increases the risk of a future stroke, making it a critical warning sign that requires medical attention.\",4\n894,LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY,LVH is part of an important event chain leading from hypertension to heart failure,3\n1546,Β RECEPTOR BLOCKERS,Beta receptor blockers are antihypertensive drugs that improve long-term prognosis in patients with myocardial infarction and are recommended for use in hypertension with coronary artery disease>,2\n890,LVH,\"**Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH)** is a cardiac condition characterized by the thickening of the heart's left ventricle, often resulting from increased pressure load due to underlying conditions such as **hypertension** or **aortic stenosis**. LVH is recognized as a **typical target organ damage** caused by chronic hypertension and serves as an **independent risk factor for cardiovascular events**, including **heart failure** and **stroke**. It forms a critical link in the event chain where hypertension progresses to more severe cardiac complications.  \n\nWhile LVH is associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, studies indicate that it can be **reversed with antihypertensive treatment**, leading to an improved prognosis. This reversibility underscores the importance of early detection and management. Additionally, LVH is frequently observed as a **cardiac complication in hypertensive patients**, further emphasizing its clinical significance in cardiovascular health.  \n\nIn summary, LVH is both a **predictor and consequence** of cardiovascular disease, with its development and progression closely tied to hypertension. Timely intervention through blood pressure control can mitigate risks and improve patient outcomes.\",16\n891,HEART FAILURE,\"**Heart Failure** is a chronic cardiovascular condition characterized by the heart's inability to pump blood effectively to meet the body's needs. It is closely linked to hypertension, with long-term high blood pressure contributing to its development, particularly through complications such as left ventricular hypertrophy. Heart failure is also a potential complication of aortic stenosis due to increased cardiac workload.  \n\nThe condition is classified into subtypes, including **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)** and **heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)**. Treatment strategies vary depending on the subtype but commonly include medications such as **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**, **angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)**, **angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs)**, and **mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)**, particularly for HFrEF. These therapies aim to improve outcomes and reduce mortality.  \n\nHeart failure has a rising prevalence in China and globally, with its risk significantly influenced by blood pressure levels. Proactive blood pressure management can help lower the likelihood of developing this condition. Overall, heart failure remains a major medical concern due to its chronic nature, association with hypertension, and the need for targeted pharmacological interventions.\",10\n1402,RAS INHIBITOR,\"**RAS Inhibitors** (Renin-Angiotensin System inhibitors) are a class of drugs primarily used to treat hypertension and heart failure. They include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). These medications are often combined with other drugs to enhance efficacy and minimize side effects.  \n\nRAS inhibitors are particularly beneficial for high-risk hypertensive patients with conditions such as left atrial enlargement, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), or reduced cardiac function, as they may help reduce the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. Additionally, they are used in managing connective tissue disease (CTD)-related hypertension and have been shown to improve endothelial function and inflammation markers.  \n\nOverall, RAS inhibitors play a critical role in cardiovascular disease management, offering therapeutic benefits beyond blood pressure control, including potential protective effects on heart structure and function.\",9\n1428,RAS INHIBITORS,\"**RAS inhibitors** (Renin-Angiotensin System inhibitors) are a class of antihypertensive medications that include **ACE inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI)**. These drugs are primarily used to treat **hypertension** and have demonstrated efficacy in patients with **coronary artery disease**. Additionally, they play a significant role in managing **kidney disease**, particularly in reducing **proteinuria** and protecting **target organs**, such as the kidneys, through mechanisms that extend beyond blood pressure control. Due to their renal protective effects, RAS inhibitors are often prioritized in treatment plans for **renal parenchymal hypertension**. Their broad therapeutic applications make them a cornerstone in managing cardiovascular and renal conditions.\",7\n1426,氯沙坦干预降低高血压患者终点实践研究,氯沙坦干预降低高血压患者终点实践研究表明降压治疗逆转 LVH 可降低心血管事件发生和死亡风险,2\n955,SOKOLOW-LYON VOLTAGE,Sokolow-Lyon voltage is a method used to screen for LVH via electrocardiogram,1\n956,CORNELL VOLTAGE-TIME PRODUCT,Cornell voltage-time product is another method used to screen for LVH via electrocardiogram,1\n960,超声心动图,\"超声心动图 (echocardiography) is a diagnostic method used to detect LVH and assess cardiac damage from hypertension\"\"\",1\n961,心电图,\"心电图 (electrocardiogram) is a screening tool for LVH and other cardiac abnormalities related to hypertension\"\"\",1\n1493,CGA,\"CGA stands for Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment, used in evaluating elderly patients with hypertension and other conditions\",4\n1861,CTD,\"CTD is a connective tissue disease that requires early diagnosis and effective treatment to improve prognosis.
