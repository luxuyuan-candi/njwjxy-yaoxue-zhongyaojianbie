It is known that substances like niacin (烟酸) can help reduce its levels in the body. This measurement is widely used in clinical settings to evaluate and manage heart health.\",2\n4374,TG,\"**TG (Triglycerides)** are a type of fat (lipid) found in the blood. Elevated levels of triglycerides are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, contributing to what is known as cardiovascular residual risk. High triglyceride levels are considered a significant factor in assessing overall cardiovascular health. The descriptions consistently emphasize that triglycerides, as a lipid component, play a role in elevating cardiovascular risk when present in excessive amounts.  \n\nIn summary, TG (Triglycerides) are blood fats that, at high concentrations, pose a heightened risk to cardiovascular health, reinforcing their importance in risk assessment and management.\",13\n1371,HDL-C,\"**HDL-C (High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol)** is an important lipid marker often referred to as \"\"good cholesterol\"\" due to its protective role against cardiovascular disease. It functions by helping to remove LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) cholesterol from the arteries, thereby reducing the risk of plaque buildup. While HDL-C is a secondary target for lipid-lowering therapy, this is typically considered when LDL-C levels are already at their target. Overall, HDL-C serves as a key indicator of cardiovascular health and a beneficial component in lipid management.\",9\n4483,APOCⅢ,\"\nApolipoprotein C-III, a protein targeted by volanesorsen to reduce triglyceride levels\"\"\",2\n4471,NICOTINIC ACID,Nicotinic acid (niacin) is a lipid-modifying drug sometimes combined with other agents for severe hypertriglyceridemia>,1\n1363,PCSK9抑制剂,\"PCSK9 inhibitors, a class of drugs used to further lower LDL-C in patients unresponsive to statins>\",4\n4465,贝特类药物,,4\n813,混合型高脂血症,\"**Mixed Hyperlipidemia (混合型高脂血症)** is a medical condition that is the focus of an expert consensus document.

This condition falls under the broader category of hyperlipidemia and requires careful management due to its association with increased cardiovascular risk. The expert consensus document likely provides guidelines or recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of this disorder.  \n\nThe summary integrates both descriptions, clarifying that mixed hyperlipidemia involves elevated cholesterol and triglycerides while also acknowledging its significance as a subject of medical consensus.

It is targeted by therapeutic agents such as **ω-3 fatty acids**, which promote its clearance or inhibit its generation.

Together, these interventions highlight the role of VLDL-C in lipid metabolism and its significance as a target for managing triglyceride levels in the blood.  \n\n*(Note: The descriptions are complementary, with one emphasizing the mechanism of ω-3 fatty acids and the other noting the effect of niacin, resulting in a coherent summary.)*\",3\n4461,Ω-3脂肪酸,处方级ω-3脂肪酸可通过抑制VLDL-C生成、促进VLDL-C清除或激活蛋白脂肪酶活性，降低TG水平,4\n4480,VOLANESORSEN,\"**Volanesorsen** is an antisense oligonucleotide drug studied for its potential in reducing triglyceride (TG) levels, particularly in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome.
