They function by increasing serotonin levels in the brain, which helps alleviate symptoms of depression and other mood disorders.  \n\nSSRIs are frequently considered for use during pregnancy, though certain precautions apply. While most SSRIs are generally not associated with fetal heart disease or death, paroxetine is an exception, as it may increase the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight. As a result, healthcare providers often avoid prescribing paroxetine to pregnant patients, opting for alternative SSRIs when necessary.  \n\nOverall, SSRIs remain a cornerstone in depression treatment due to their efficacy and relatively favorable safety profile, though individual patient factors—such as pregnancy—require careful consideration when selecting the appropriate medication.\",16\r\n5061,FLUOXETINE,\"**FLUOXETINE** is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant used to treat depression and other mood disorders. As an SSRI, it works by increasing serotonin levels in the brain, but this mechanism also carries certain risks. One notable concern is its potential to accumulate as active metabolites in infants, making it advisable to avoid during breastfeeding. Additionally, FLUOXETINE poses a risk of serotonin syndrome—a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by excessive serotonin activity—when combined with other serotonergic drugs such as linezolid. This interaction occurs due to synergistic effects on serotonin metabolism, underscoring the importance of careful medication management when prescribing FLUOXETINE.  \n\nIn summary, while FLUOXETINE is an effective antidepressant, its use requires caution, particularly in breastfeeding individuals and when co-administered with other drugs that affect serotonin levels.\",2\r\n5269,5-HT REGULATOR,\"5-hydroxytryptamine regulator, a class of antidepressant medications\",1\r\n5283,PAROXETINE,,1\r\n5286,质子泵抑制剂,Gastric protective agents recommended when combining SSRIs with anticoagulants/antiplatelets,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n5680,SSRIS,SNRIS,\"Both are classes of antidepressants with different mechanisms of action\nBoth are classes of antidepressant medications with different neurotransmitter effects\",28\r\n5732,SSRIS,FLUOXETINE,Fluoxetine is an SSRI with special breastfeeding precautions,18\r\n5715,5-HT REGULATOR,SSRIS,Both affect serotonin regulation but through different mechanisms,17\r\n5731,SSRIS,PAROXETINE,Paroxetine is an SSRI with unique pregnancy risks compared to other SSRIs,17\r\n5745,SSRIS,质子泵抑制剂,Proton pump inhibitors should be co-prescribed with SSRIs when using anticoagulants/antiplatelets,17\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
