EULAR has collaborated extensively with the **American College of Rheumatology (ACR)** to develop and standardize classification criteria for gout. In 2015, EULAR and ACR jointly established updated classification criteria for gout, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy and consistency. Building on this work, in 2018, EULAR further recommended a **three-step diagnostic approach** for gout, emphasizing systematic evaluation to enhance clinical decision-making.  \n\nThese efforts highlight EULAR's commitment to fostering international collaboration and evidence-based guidelines in rheumatology. Despite slight variations in the organization's name across descriptions—referred to as both the \"\"European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology\"\" and the \"\"European League Against Rheumatism\"\"—these terms are used interchangeably, with no substantive contradiction in their roles or activities. The organization remains a key player in shaping global standards for rheumatic diseases, particularly gout.  \n\nIn summary, EULAR is a leading European rheumatology organization that works closely with ACR to develop classification and diagnostic criteria, ensuring alignment between European and international practices.
