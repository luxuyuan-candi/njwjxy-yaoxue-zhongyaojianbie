Pitavastatin is prescribed to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Its efficacy and safety profile make it a viable option for patients requiring moderate lipid-lowering therapy.

It is designed to simplify treatment regimens by reducing the number of pills a patient needs to take, thereby improving adherence. SPCs typically include antihypertensive and lipid-lowering agents, making them suitable for patients with both high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol levels.  \n\nClinical evidence highlights SPC's dual benefits: it effectively manages hypertension while also addressing hypercholesterolemia, offering a convenient and efficient therapeutic option. Additionally, SPCs are recognized for their relative safety in clinical practice, with no significant adverse effects reported beyond those expected from the individual components.  \n\nWhile the term \"\"SPC\"\" broadly refers to single-pill combinations in pharmacology, the provided descriptions specifically emphasize its role in cardiovascular care, particularly for patients requiring combined antihypertensive and lipid-modifying therapy.
