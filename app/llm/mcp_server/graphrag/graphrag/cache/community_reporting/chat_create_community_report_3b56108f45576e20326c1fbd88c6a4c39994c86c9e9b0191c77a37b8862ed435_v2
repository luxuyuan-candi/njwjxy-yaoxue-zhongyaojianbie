It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis, and accelerates arterial hardening by damaging vascular endothelium, thereby increasing the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events.  \n\nHypertension is closely linked to hyperlipidemia (高脂血症), with the two often coexisting as part of the \"\"three highs\"\" (alongside high blood sugar), collectively threatening the health of individuals, particularly diabetic patients. It is both a risk factor for and a potential consequence of hyperlipidemia, forming a bidirectional relationship. Specific treatment principles exist for managing hypertension accompanied by hyperlipidemia, as hypertensive patients are considered a high-risk group for developing hyperlipidemia.  \n\nThe condition is prevalent among middle-aged and elderly populations, marked by high incidence rates, prolonged duration, and multiple complications, making it a significant public health concern. Additionally, hypertension can arise as an adverse effect of glucocorticoid use.  \n\nIn summary, hypertension is a multifaceted cardiovascular disease with systemic implications, frequently associated with metabolic disorders like hyperlipidemia and diabetes. Its management requires addressing interrelated risk factors to mitigate long-term health consequences.\",47\r\n2049,心脑血管疾病,\"心脑血管疾病 refers to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, a key outcome targeted in risk management\"\"\",5\r\n1996,左心室肥厚,\"左心室肥厚（Left Ventricular Hypertrophy, LVH）是一种心脏结构异常，表现为左心室壁增厚，通常由长期压力或容量负荷过重引起。根据描述，左心室肥厚可通过心电图（ECG）或超声心动图（echocardiographic criteria）诊断，并被确认为动脉粥样硬化性心血管疾病（ASCVD）的风险标志之一。此外，左心室肥厚也可能是高血压合并血脂异常所导致的心脏并发症，提示其与代谢紊乱及心血管系统慢性损伤密切相关。  \n\n综合来看，左心室肥厚既是心血管疾病风险的独立预测因子，又与高血压和血脂异常等代谢性疾病相互作用，可能进一步加剧心脏功能障碍。其诊断和监测对评估患者ASCVD风险及制定干预策略具有重要意义。\",3\r\n1168,颈动脉内膜中层厚度,\"**颈动脉内膜中层厚度 (Carotid Intima-Media Thickness, CIMT)** is a clinical measurement used to assess cardiovascular risk.

A CIMT value of **≥0.9 mm** or the presence of plaque in the carotid artery is considered an indicator of increased risk for **atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)**. This measurement serves as a non-invasive tool to identify early signs of arterial thickening and atherosclerosis, aiding in the early detection and management of cardiovascular conditions.  \n\nThe assessment of CIMT is widely utilized in preventive cardiology to stratify patients' risk levels, guiding interventions such as lifestyle modifications or medical therapies to mitigate future cardiovascular events.\",2\r\n1189,Β-受体阻滞剂,\"Beta-Blockers, a class of drugs that reduce blood pressure by blocking the effects of adrenaline\"\"\",2\r\n1431,脑血管事件,脑血管事件的发生显著提高了患者的生活质量和预期寿命,2\r\n4439,心血管危险因素,\"Risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, obesity, and family history of early cardiovascular disease\",1\r\n4441,继发性高血压,\"Hypertension caused by an underlying condition, which requires further evaluation and treatment\",1\r\n4442,微量白蛋白尿,\"Small amounts of albumin in the urine, an early sign of kidney damage related to hypertension\",1\r\n4443,血肌酐浓度轻度升高,\"Mild elevation of serum creatinine, indicating potential kidney dysfunction\",1\r\n4444,脑血管疾病,\"Cerebrovascular diseases including ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and TIA, associated with hypertension\",1\r\n4445,心脏疾病,\"Cardiac conditions such as angina, myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation linked to hypertension\",1\r\n4446,外周血管疾病,Peripheral vascular diseases that may be caused or exacerbated by hypertension,1\r\n4447,肾脏疾病,\"Kidney diseases including significant creatinine elevation or reduced eGFR, related to hypertension\",1\r\n4448,重度高血压性视网膜病变,\"Severe hypertensive retinopathy characterized by hemorrhages, exudates, or papilledema\",1\r\n317,心血管疾病,\"**Cardiovascular Disease**  \n\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) encompasses a class of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels, frequently linked to atherosclerosis—a buildup of plaque in arterial walls that restricts blood flow. These disorders include coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, and hypertension, among others. CVD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with risk factors such as poor diet, physical inactivity, smoking, and genetic predisposition playing significant roles.  \n\nAdditionally, cardiovascular disease has clinical relevance in the management of other conditions, such as gout, where systemic inflammation and metabolic factors may influence both CVD risk and gout progression. This intersection highlights the importance of comprehensive treatment strategies that address underlying cardiovascular health alongside primary conditions.  \n\nIn summary, cardiovascular disease involves a broad spectrum of heart and blood vessel disorders, often associated with atherosclerosis, and intersects with other medical considerations, including gout management.

The Chinese and English versions align in their messaging, highlighting the critical role of blood pressure management in preventing these conditions. The combined summary reinforces the importance of addressing hypertension to mitigate the risks associated with heart and cerebrovascular diseases.  \n\n(Word count: 124)\",52\r\n1637,高血压,左心室肥厚,\"Hypertension (高血压) is a significant medical condition that often leads to left ventricular hypertrophy (左心室肥厚), a thickening of the heart's left ventricle wall. This occurs as the heart works harder to pump blood against elevated arterial pressure, resulting in structural changes over time. Additionally, hypertension combined with dyslipidemia (血脂异常) may further contribute to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, as the interplay between high blood pressure and abnormal lipid levels exacerbates cardiovascular strain. Together, these factors highlight the importance of managing hypertension and associated metabolic disorders to prevent or mitigate left ventricular hypertrophy and its complications.  \n\nIn summary, hypertension is a primary driver of left ventricular hypertrophy, and its coexistence with dyslipidemia may intensify this effect, underscoring the need for comprehensive cardiovascular risk management.\",50\r\n968,高血压,颈动脉内膜中层厚度,Increased carotid IMT is associated with hypertension,49\r\n992,Β-受体阻滞剂,高血压,Beta-Blockers are one of the primary medications used to treat hypertension,49\r\n1229,脑血管事件,高血压,高血压是导致脑血管事件的重要危险因素,49\r\n4560,高血压,心血管危险因素,Hypertension is one of the cardiovascular risk factors listed in the guidelines,48\r\n4562,高血压,继发性高血压,Secondary hypertension is a specific type of hypertension that requires further evaluation,48\r\n4566,高血压,微量白蛋白尿,Hypertension can lead to microalbuminuria as an early sign of kidney damage,48\r\n4567,高血压,血肌酐浓度轻度升高,Hypertension may cause mild elevation of serum creatinine indicating kidney impairment,48\r\n4569,高血压,脑血管疾病,Hypertension is a major risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases,48\r\n4570,高血压,心脏疾病,Hypertension significantly increases risk of various cardiac conditions,48\r\n4571,高血压,外周血管疾病,Hypertension contributes to the development of peripheral vascular diseases,48\r\n4572,高血压,肾脏疾病,Hypertension is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease,48\r\n4573,高血压,重度高血压性视网膜病变,Severe hypertensive retinopathy is a direct consequence of uncontrolled hypertension,48\r\n285,心血管疾病,痛风,Gout patients with cardiovascular disease require special consideration in medication selection,40\r\n1641,血脂异常,糖尿病,血脂异常和糖尿病有与超重和肥胖相关的共同病理生理学机制,36\r\n1356,FDR,太极拳,This traditional exercise is recommended as part of FDr treatment.,29\r\n1217,阿托伐他汀钙,心血管事件,阿托伐他汀钙能降低心血管事件发生风险,27\r\n1199,高血脂,心血管疾病,Hyperlipidemia significantly contributes to the development of cardiovascular diseases,17\r\n1771,高血压病,血脂异常,高血压病和血脂异常都是心血管综合征的一部分，两者相互影响，需要综合治疗,14\r\n941,尿液分析,难治性高血压,Urinalysis assists in identifying secondary causes of resistant hypertension,8\r\n942,超声心动图,难治性高血压,Echocardiography assesses cardiac complications in resistant hypertension,8\r\n943,颈动脉B型超声,难治性高血压,Carotid ultrasound evaluates vascular damage in resistant hypertension,8\r\n944,难治性高血压,血生化,Basic metabolic tests help evaluate causes of resistant hypertension,8\r\n1654,志愿者,健康加油站模式,Volunteers assisted in implementing community health programs,7\r\n3515,美国医学界组织,美国心脏协会,Both organizations are involved in research and guidelines related to cholesterol and heart health,5\r\n1649,乡村医生,高血压控制项目,Village doctors were trained to implement the hypertension control project in rural areas,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
