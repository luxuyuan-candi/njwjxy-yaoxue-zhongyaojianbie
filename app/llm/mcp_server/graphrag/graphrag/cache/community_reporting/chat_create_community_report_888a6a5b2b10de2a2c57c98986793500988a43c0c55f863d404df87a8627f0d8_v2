Additionally, β 受体阻滞剂 may cause a slight increase in overall lipid levels, potentially exacerbating conditions like hyperlipidemia and reducing treatment efficacy in affected patients.  \n\nWhen prescribing β 受体阻滞剂, healthcare providers should consider the patient's lipid profile, as the medication could worsen lipid-related health issues.
