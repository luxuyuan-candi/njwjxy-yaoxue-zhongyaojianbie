Launched in December 2021, the journal covers a broad spectrum of topics in general practice, including cardiovascular health, hypertension management, hyperlipidemia, pediatric care, family medicine, and common illnesses such as influenza and dermatitis.  \n\nThe journal serves as a key resource for evidence-based guidelines, featuring publications like the *Expert Consensus on Mixed Hyperlipidemia in Primary Care* and multiple guidelines on hypertension management, including articles released in April 2019 (Volume 18, Issue 4) and August 2019. It also addresses mental health topics, such as depression treatment, and provides protocols for ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) risk assessment.  \n\nRegular issues include the May 2025 edition (Volume 24, Issue 5), which highlights research on general practice medicine. By consolidating clinical research, treatment recommendations, and consensus statements, the journal supports primary care physicians in delivering comprehensive and up-to-date patient care across China.  \n\nIn summary, *中华全科医师杂志* is a leading Chinese medical journal focused on advancing general practice through the dissemination of research, clinical guidelines, and expert consensus on a wide range of health issues relevant to primary care.\",39\r\n869,高血压亚急症,\"**Hypertensive Urgency (高血压亚急症)**  \n\nHypertensive urgency, also known as 高血压亚急症, is a medical condition characterized by a significant elevation in blood pressure without evidence of acute target organ damage. This condition is distinct from hypertensive emergencies, as it does not involve immediate life-threatening complications such as heart failure, stroke, or kidney injury. However, it remains a serious clinical situation that requires prompt medical intervention to prevent progression to more severe complications.  \n\nCommon causes of hypertensive urgency include poor adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications or insufficient treatment regimens. Patients often present with severely elevated blood pressure but lack symptoms of acute organ dysfunction. Management typically involves the use of oral antihypertensive medications to gradually lower blood pressure over hours to days, avoiding rapid reductions that could lead to complications.  \n\nWhile less immediately dangerous than hypertensive emergencies, hypertensive urgency still poses a significant health risk if left untreated. Medical professionals emphasize the importance of timely evaluation and adjustment of therapy to stabilize blood pressure and reduce long-term cardiovascular risks. Close follow-up is recommended to ensure effective control and prevent recurrence.  \n\nIn summary, hypertensive urgency (高血压亚急症) is a clinically important condition marked by severely high blood pressure without acute organ damage, necessitating prompt but controlled treatment with oral medications and careful monitoring to avoid further complications.\",4\r\n670,布地奈德,A nasal corticosteroid spray used for treating allergic rhinitis,2\r\n3546,MECT,\"MECT is a treatment method for patients with severe depression, including those with refusal to eat, suicidal risk, hallucinations, delusions, or tension syndrome, and is considered a first-line treatment option for rapid symptom control.
