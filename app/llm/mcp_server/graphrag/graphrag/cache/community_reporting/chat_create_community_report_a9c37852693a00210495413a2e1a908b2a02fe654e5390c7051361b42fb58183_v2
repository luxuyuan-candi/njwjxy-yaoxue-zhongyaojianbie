It poses significant health risks, including cardiovascular complications, particularly in hypertensive patients. CKD is also associated with metabolic disturbances, such as secondary high cholesterol, which further exacerbates cardiovascular risks. The disease's impact on kidney function and its role in contributing to other systemic conditions, like hypertension and dyslipidemia, underscores its importance as a major public health concern. Managing CKD involves addressing both renal dysfunction and its secondary effects, such as cardiovascular disease and elevated cholesterol levels, to mitigate long-term complications.\",2\r\n2214,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,\"**High Blood Pressure**  \n\nHigh blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a common medical condition that significantly increases the risk of serious cardiovascular diseases, including heart disease and stroke. It frequently occurs in individuals who are obese, maintain unhealthy diets, or have a family history of hypertension or high cholesterol. The condition is closely linked to high cholesterol, further exacerbating cardiovascular risks.  \n\nWhile high blood pressure can affect a wide range of people, certain lifestyle and genetic factors heighten susceptibility. Managing the condition often involves dietary changes, weight management, and, in some cases, medication to reduce long-term health complications. The interplay between hypertension, cholesterol, and cardiovascular health underscores the importance of early detection and proactive management.\",4\r\n1571,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,\"**High Cholesterol** is a common metabolic condition characterized by elevated levels of lipids in the blood, particularly total cholesterol (TC ≥ 5.2 mmol/L or exceeding 5.72 mmol/L). It is prevalent among middle-aged and elderly individuals, as well as those with obesity, unhealthy diets, or a family history of hypertension or high cholesterol. The condition is a type of hyperlipidemia and can be classified as primary (genetic) or secondary (caused by underlying diseases or medications).  \n\nHigh cholesterol is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and stroke. Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is particularly harmful, contributing to arterial hardening and plaque buildup, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. The condition often coexists with hypertension, further increasing cardiovascular risks.  \n\nWhile high cholesterol is frequently linked to lifestyle factors such as poor diet and lack of exercise, genetic predisposition also plays a significant role. Management typically involves dietary modifications, increased physical activity, and, when necessary, medication to lower lipid levels and reduce the risk of severe complications.\",18\r\n1112,GUANGZHOU,\"Guangzhou is a major city in China that has been the focus of several epidemiological and health-related studies. It served as a key location for a survey on high cholesterol conducted in tertiary hospitals, highlighting its role in cardiovascular health research. Additionally, Guangzhou was one of the cities included in epidemiological studies on functional diarrhea, underscoring its importance in gastrointestinal health research as well. These studies demonstrate Guangzhou's significance as a hub for medical and public health investigations in China, contributing to broader understandings of both metabolic and digestive disorders. The city's involvement in diverse health research areas reflects its prominence as a center for scientific and clinical studies.\",2\r\n2229,THYROID FUNCTION DISORDER,\"Thyroid function disorders can lead to secondary high cholesterol.\"\"\",1\r\n1581,HIGH-LIPID BLOOD DISEASE,\"A medical condition characterized by elevated levels of lipids in the blood, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.\"\"\",4\r\n197,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,\"**Cardiovascular Diseases** are a group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels, often linked to high lipid levels, high cholesterol, and other risk factors such as high blood pressure and hyperuricemia. These diseases are a leading cause of death globally and encompass a wide range of conditions, including atherosclerosis, angina, myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and cerebral thrombosis.  \n\nElevated lipid levels, particularly cholesterol, are a common contributor to the development of cardiovascular diseases, as they can lead to plaque buildup in arteries, restricting blood flow and increasing the risk of complications. Additionally, hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels) has been identified as an independent risk factor, with studies showing a correlation between rising uric acid levels and increased mortality rates in both men and women.  \n\nThe conditions under the umbrella of cardiovascular diseases often share overlapping causes and risk factors, including poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, and genetic predisposition. Preventive measures such as lifestyle modifications, medication, and regular medical check-ups can help mitigate these risks and reduce the incidence of severe outcomes.  \n\nIn summary, cardiovascular diseases represent a significant global health burden, driven by multiple interrelated factors, with high lipid levels, cholesterol, blood pressure, and uric acid playing key roles in their development and progression.\",9\r\n198,NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES,\"Hyperuricemia is linked to ischemic stroke and poor prognosis, though physiological uric acid levels may have neuroprotective effects.\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2355,CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE,HYPERTENSION,Hypertension can lead to or exacerbate chronic kidney disease,41\r\n1542,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,High blood pressure and high lipidemia are both risk factors for cardiovascular diseases,29\r\n1113,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,HIGH TRIGLYCERIDES,Both are types of hyperlipidemia,22\r\n1771,GUANGZHOU,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,A survey on high cholesterol was conducted in Guangzhou's tertiary hospitals,20\r\n1569,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,THYROID FUNCTION DISORDER,Thyroid function disorders can lead to secondary high cholesterol.,19\r\n1118,HIGH-LIPID BLOOD DISEASE,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,High lipid levels in the blood are a significant risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases.,13\r\n133,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES,\"Both are influenced by hyperuricemia, with cardiovascular diseases increasing the risk of neurological complications like stroke.\",10\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
