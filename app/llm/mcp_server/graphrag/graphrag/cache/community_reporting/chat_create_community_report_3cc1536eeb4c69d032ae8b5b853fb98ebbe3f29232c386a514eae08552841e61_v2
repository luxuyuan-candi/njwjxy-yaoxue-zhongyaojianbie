It plays a pivotal role in formulating consensus guidelines and expert recommendations to bridge TCM with modern medical approaches.  \n\nOne of its key contributions is the **Expert Consensus on Traditional Chinese Medicine Diagnosis and Treatment of Functional Diarrhea (2023)**, which integrates research from both TCM and Western medicine to establish clinical guidelines for managing this condition. This consensus was developed and published through the **CACM's Branch of Gastrointestinal Diseases**, highlighting the association's structured approach to addressing specific medical disciplines.  \n\nBy fostering collaboration between traditional and contemporary medical practices, the CACM ensures that its guidelines are evidence-based and clinically relevant. The organization serves as a central authority in promoting TCM's integration into broader healthcare frameworks while maintaining its cultural and historical roots.  \n\nIn summary, the **China Association of Chinese Medicine** is a leading professional body that advances TCM through research, consensus-building, and interdisciplinary collaboration, with a demonstrated focus on gastrointestinal health and functional diarrhea in its recent expert guidelines.\",3\r\n1451,CHINESE JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED TRADITIONAL AND WESTERN MEDICINE DIGESTION,,3\r\n1923,ZHAO D,\"Zhao D is a researcher involved in the Sino-MONICA-Beijing stroke study.\"\"\",1\r\n1924,LIU J,\"Liu J is a researcher contributing to the Sino-MONICA-Beijing project.\"\"\",1\r\n1925,WANG W,\"Wang W is a researcher involved in Chinese stroke epidemiology.\"\"\",1\r\n3825,SIMPLIFIED TAI CHI,A form of exercise recommended for obese individuals as part of their rehabilitation program,1\r\n1055,CHINESE PAIN MEDICINE ASSOCIATION,\"Chinese Pain Medicine Association is involved in pain treatment and research, collaborating with the China-Japan Friendship Hospital Pain Specialty Medical Alliance and Beijing Pain Treatment Quality Control and Improvement Center to publish expert consensus on chronic musculoskeletal pain.\"\"\",2\r\n4155,BEIJING YOU'AN HOSPITAL,\"A hospital affiliated with Capital Medical University where Li Tongzeng works\"\"\",2\r\n4176,EXPERT CONSENSUS ON TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF ABDOMINAL PAIN (2023),\"An expert consensus event aimed at standardizing the diagnosis and treatment of abdominal pain using traditional Chinese medicine methods\"\"\",2\r\n4511,DEPARTMENT OF CARDIOLOGY,Medical department at Beijing Friendship Hospital where Huang Rongchong works,2\r\n4844,ELDERLY POPULATION,Elderly individuals who are at higher risk of adverse drug interactions due to multiple medication use,4\r\n4845,SWEDISH PRESCRIPTION DRUG REGISTRY,,1\r\n698,CHI CHUNHUA,\"Corresponding author affiliated with Peking University First Hospital, specializing in general practice and health management\"\"\",1\r\n707,HEALTH MANAGEMENT CENTER OF PEKING UNIVERSITY FIRST HOSPITAL,\"Specialized department at Peking University First Hospital\"\"\",1\r\n1050,NATIONAL CLINICAL KEY SPECIALTY · PAIN SPECIALTY MEDICAL ALLIANCE OF CHINA-JAPAN FRIENDSHIP HOSPITAL,\"A national-level medical alliance specializing in pain treatment and management.\"\"\",2\r\n3337,KARLSSON,A Swedish scientist who conducted research on the effects of exercise on lipoprotein levels>,2\r\n4154,LI TONGZENG,\"Li Tongzeng is a chief physician at the Department of Respiratory and Infectious Diseases, Beijing You'an Hospital, Capital Medical University, who commented on COVID-19 treatment misconceptions\"\"\",2\r\n4160,COVID-19,,2\r\n4177,CHINESE MEDICINE,\"The broader system of traditional Chinese medicine practices referenced in the consensus\"\"\",1\r\n4580,《混合型高脂血症基层诊疗中国专家共识（2024 年）》 编写专家组,\"A group of experts responsible for drafting the 2024 Chinese expert consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of mixed hyperlipidemia at the primary care level\"\"\",1\r\n5383,LI LJ,\"Li LJ is an author of the Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of depression in China published by Chinese Medicine Multimedia Press in 2015.\"\"\",1\r\n5384,MA X,\"Ma X is an author of the Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of depression in China published by Chinese Medicine Multimedia Press in 2015.\"\"\",1\r\n1053,CHINA-JAPAN FRIENDSHIP HOSPITAL,\"A major hospital involved in pain specialty medical alliances and research.\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n900,CHINA,HYPERTENSION,Chinese population shows high prevalence of hypertension risk factors,97\r\n2958,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,UNITED STATES,The United States recommends lipid checks for children at risk of coronary heart disease,58\r\n6074,李继梅,专家委员会,李继梅是专家委员会的成员，参与脑卒中康复指导工作,56\r\n3330,BEIJING,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,A survey on high cholesterol was conducted in Beijing's tertiary hospitals,51\r\n3331,SHANGHAI,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,A survey on high cholesterol was conducted in Shanghai's tertiary hospitals,41\r\n1583,SINO-MONICA-BEIJING PROJECT,CHINA,The Sino-MONICA-Beijing Project was conducted in China.,22\r\n832,PEOPLE'S MEDICAL PUBLISHING HOUSE,BEIJING,\"The **People's Medical Publishing House** is a publishing organization headquartered in **Beijing**, China.
