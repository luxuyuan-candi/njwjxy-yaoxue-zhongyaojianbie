Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\r\n4440,靶器官损害,\"**靶器官损害 (Target Organ Damage)** refers to acute or chronic damage to vital organs resulting from severely elevated blood pressure in hypertensive conditions. This condition primarily affects organs such as the heart, kidneys, and brain, which are highly susceptible to the detrimental effects of uncontrolled hypertension.  \n\nIn hypertensive emergencies, severely elevated blood pressure can lead to acute organ damage, posing immediate risks to the affected individual. Over time, chronic hypertension may also cause progressive harm to these organs, impairing their function and increasing the risk of complications such as heart failure, kidney disease, or stroke.  \n\nThe term encompasses both sudden, life-threatening damage and long-term structural or functional deterioration due to sustained high blood pressure. Early detection and management of hypertension are critical in preventing or mitigating 靶器官损害 and its associated health consequences.\",3\r\n1200,高血压急症,\"**Hypertension Emergency (高血压急症)**  \n\nHypertension emergency, or 高血压急症, is a critical medical condition marked by a severe and sudden elevation in blood pressure, accompanied by acute damage to vital target organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys. This condition constitutes a medical emergency, as the rapid rise in blood pressure leads to progressive dysfunction in these organs, necessitating immediate intervention to prevent life-threatening complications.  \n\nThe defining feature of hypertension emergency is not just the high blood pressure itself but the presence of acute organ damage, distinguishing it from less severe hypertensive states. Without prompt treatment, the condition can result in serious consequences, including stroke, heart failure, kidney failure, or other irreversible organ injuries.  \n\nManagement typically involves rapid but controlled blood pressure reduction using intravenous medications in a hospital setting, with close monitoring to avoid complications from overly aggressive treatment. The urgency of addressing hypertension emergency underscores the importance of recognizing its symptoms—such as severe headache, chest pain, visual disturbances, or neurological deficits—and seeking immediate medical care.  \n\nIn summary, hypertension emergency is a dangerous and time-sensitive condition requiring urgent medical attention to mitigate organ damage and stabilize the patient.\",7\r\n1201,高血压亚急症,\"**Hypertensive Urgency (高血压亚急症)**  \n\nHypertensive urgency, also known as 高血压亚急症, is a medical condition characterized by a significant elevation in blood pressure without evidence of acute target organ damage. This condition is distinct from hypertensive emergencies, as it does not involve immediate life-threatening complications such as heart failure, stroke, or kidney injury. However, it remains a serious clinical situation that requires prompt medical intervention to prevent progression to more severe complications.  \n\nCommon causes of hypertensive urgency include poor adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications or insufficient treatment regimens. Patients often present with severely elevated blood pressure but lack symptoms of acute organ dysfunction. Management typically involves the use of oral antihypertensive medications to gradually lower blood pressure over hours to days, avoiding rapid reductions that could lead to complications.  \n\nWhile less immediately dangerous than hypertensive emergencies, hypertensive urgency still poses a significant health risk if left untreated. Medical professionals emphasize the importance of timely evaluation and adjustment of therapy to stabilize blood pressure and reduce long-term cardiovascular risks. Close follow-up is recommended to ensure effective control and prevent recurrence.  \n\nIn summary, hypertensive urgency (高血压亚急症) is a clinically important condition marked by severely high blood pressure without acute organ damage, necessitating prompt but controlled treatment with oral medications and careful monitoring to avoid further complications.\",5\r\n4462,国家基本公共卫生服务规范,\"A national standard for public health services in China, referenced for hypertension patient follow-up\",2\r\n4464,主动脉夹层,,1\r\n4463,妊娠合并高血压急症,Hypertensive emergency in pregnant patients requiring careful blood pressure management to protect placental circulation,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n4561,高血压,靶器官损害,\"Hypertension can lead to damage in target organs such as the heart, kidneys, and brain\",50\r\n1010,高血压急症,高血压亚急症,\"Both are conditions related to significantly elevated blood pressure, but differ in the presence of acute target organ damage\",12\r\n4605,国家基本公共卫生服务规范,高血压急症,The standard provides guidelines for the management of hypertensive emergencies as part of public health services,9\r\n4608,高血压急症,主动脉夹层,Aortic dissection is a type of hypertensive emergency requiring the most urgent treatment,8\r\n4609,高血压急症,妊娠合并高血压急症,Pregnancy with hypertensive emergency is a specialized form of the condition requiring unique management,8\r\n4610,高血压亚急症,靶器官损害,Hypertensive urgencies are distinguished by the absence of acute target organ damage,8\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
