It utilizes internationally certified ambulatory blood pressure monitors that undergo regular calibration to ensure accuracy. ABPM is particularly useful for diagnosing conditions such as white-coat hypertension (elevated blood pressure in clinical settings), masked hypertension (normal blood pressure in clinics but elevated elsewhere), and nocturnal hypertension (abnormally high blood pressure during sleep).  \n\nThe monitoring process involves taking measurements at regular intervals—typically every 15-20 minutes during waking hours and every 30 minutes during sleep. To ensure reliability, valid readings must cover at least 80% of the total monitoring duration, with a minimum of 20 daytime readings and 7 nighttime readings. ABPM provides comprehensive data, including average systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure values over a 24-hour period, as well as separate averages for daytime (awake) and nighttime (sleep) periods.  \n\nBy offering continuous, real-world blood pressure assessment, ABPM helps clinicians make more accurate diagnoses and tailor treatment plans for patients with hypertension-related conditions. Its ability to capture fluctuations over a full day makes it a valuable tool in cardiovascular health management.\",4\r\n830,HBPM,\"**Summary of HBPM (Home Blood Pressure Monitoring):**  \n\nHBPM (Home Blood Pressure Monitoring) is a widely used method for monitoring blood pressure, particularly in hypertensive patients. It serves multiple purposes, including identifying conditions such as white coat hypertension, masked hypertension, and resistant hypertension, as well as evaluating long-term blood pressure variability, assessing the efficacy of antihypertensive treatments, and predicting cardiovascular risk and prognosis. The diagnostic threshold for hypertension via HBPM is an average systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥135 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥85 mmHg.  \n\nHBPM can be performed by patients themselves or with the assistance of family members, making it a flexible and accessible tool for self-measured or home-based blood pressure assessment. It plays a significant role in enhancing patient health awareness, improving treatment adherence, and facilitating long-term blood pressure management. Additionally, HBPM is recognized as both a self-management tool for patients and an auxiliary diagnostic method for hypertension.  \n\nWith advancements in telemetry technology, internet-based remote HBPM and management systems are emerging as potential future models for blood pressure control. However, further research is needed to validate their effectiveness and health economic benefits. Despite its advantages, improper use of self-monitoring devices—including wearables—may lead to excessive focus on blood pressure, frequent measurements, and fluctuations, which could negatively impact patient well-being.  \n\nIn summary, HBPM is a valuable tool for general hypertension monitoring, offering diagnostic, prognostic, and self-management benefits while requiring proper implementation to maximize its advantages.\",6\r\n832,DBP,\"Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) is a key metric in blood pressure monitoring, with diagnostic thresholds for hypertension set at ≥85 mmHg for HBPM and specific averages for ABPM.\",3\r\n831,SBP,\"Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) is a key metric in blood pressure monitoring, with diagnostic thresholds for hypertension set at ≥135 mmHg for HBPM and specific averages for ABPM.\",4\r\n844,TIA,\"TIA refers to transient ischemic attack, a clinical condition related to hypertension\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n520,ABPM,HBPM,\"**Summary of ABPM and HBPM**  \n\nABPM (Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring) and HBPM (Home Blood Pressure Monitoring) are two methods used to measure and monitor blood pressure outside of a clinical setting. Both techniques serve as valuable tools for assessing blood pressure in real-world environments, providing more comprehensive data than single clinic readings.  \n\nABPM involves wearing a portable device that automatically records blood pressure at regular intervals over a 24-hour period, offering insights into fluctuations throughout daily activities and sleep. HBPM, on the other hand, relies on patients measuring their own blood pressure at home using a validated device, typically following a structured schedule.  \n\nThese methods are commonly employed to confirm diagnoses such as resistant hypertension, where blood pressure remains elevated despite treatment. Additionally, they help detect white-coat hypertension (elevated readings in clinical settings only) and masked hypertension (normal readings in clinics but elevated elsewhere). By providing a more accurate representation of a patient's blood pressure patterns, ABPM and HBPM assist healthcare providers in making informed treatment decisions.  \n\nWhile the descriptions provided are largely consistent, they collectively emphasize that both ABPM and HBPM serve the dual purpose of **confirming hypertension diagnoses** and **ongoing blood pressure monitoring** outside the clinic. The repeated mention of their role in non-clinical settings underscores their importance in improving diagnostic accuracy and long-term management of hypertension.  \n\nIn summary, ABPM and HBPM are complementary techniques that enhance blood pressure assessment by capturing real-world measurements, aiding in both diagnosis and continuous monitoring for better patient care.\",10\r\n521,HBPM,ABPM,\"Both HBPM and ABPM are methods for monitoring blood pressure outside the clinic, with HBPM focusing on home measurements and ABPM on 24-hour ambulatory monitoring.\",10\r\n523,HBPM,DBP,HBPM uses DBP (≥85 mmHg) as one of its diagnostic criteria for hypertension.,9\r\n535,SBP,DBP,\"**Summary of SBP and DBP:**  \n\nSystolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) are both key measures of blood pressure used in the diagnosis and assessment of hypertension risk. SBP represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats, while DBP reflects the pressure when the heart rests between beats. Together, these metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular health and are critical in identifying individuals at risk for hypertension or related conditions.  \n\nThe two descriptions provided emphasize the role of SBP and DBP in hypertension diagnosis and risk assessment, reinforcing their clinical importance. While the first description highlights their use in diagnosing hypertension, the second underscores their broader application in evaluating hypertension risk. There are no contradictions between the descriptions; rather, they complement each other by presenting different aspects of how these measurements are utilized in medical practice.  \n\nIn summary, SBP and DBP are essential, interrelated indicators of blood pressure that serve as foundational tools in both diagnosing hypertension and assessing an individual's overall cardiovascular risk.\",7\r\n534,TIA,SBP,TIA is a clinical condition influenced by high blood pressure (SBP),5\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
