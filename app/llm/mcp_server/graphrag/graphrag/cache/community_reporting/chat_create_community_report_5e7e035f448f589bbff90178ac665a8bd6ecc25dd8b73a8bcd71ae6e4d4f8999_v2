As a medicinal ingredient, it is incorporated into various formulations, such as **桑菊饮** (Sang Ju Yin) and **菊花决明子粥** (Chrysanthemum and Cassia Seed Porridge), the latter of which is specifically employed to address hyperlipidemia and hypertension.  \n\nIn TCM, 菊花 is recognized for its dual role in nourishing liver and kidney yin fluids (**滋养肝肾阴津**) and regulating liver qi (**疏肝理气**), making it beneficial for liver health and seasonal dietary adjustments, particularly in spring. It is classified as a **食药物质** (food-medicine substance) and is particularly effective for individuals with **痰浊内阻型** (phlegm-dampness obstruction) or **肝肾阴虚型** (liver-kidney yin deficiency) hyperlipidemia.  \n\nResearch and traditional use highlight its cardiovascular benefits, including **lipid-lowering effects** and a **mild yet consistent antihypertensive action**. Elderly individuals often blend small amounts of 菊花 with green tea to support cardiovascular health. Additionally, it is commonly brewed as a tea for its medicinal properties and soothing effects.  \n\nIn summary, 菊花 serves as a multifunctional herb in both therapeutic and dietary contexts, valued for its ability to address metabolic disorders, support liver and kidney function, and promote cardiovascular wellness.\",10\r\n2619,山楂菊花决明子茶,\"**山楂菊花决明子茶** (Hawthorn, Chrysanthemum, and Cassia Seed Tea) is a traditional herbal tea beverage made from a blend of hawthorn, chrysanthemum, and roasted cassia seeds. It is commonly consumed as a functional drink, particularly for its potential benefits in managing hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol or triglycerides). The tea combines the tartness of hawthorn, the floral notes of chrysanthemum, and the slightly bitter, nutty flavor of roasted cassia seeds.  \n\nIn traditional practices, this tea is valued for its purported health-supporting properties, though its effects may vary by individual. The inclusion of hawthorn is often associated with cardiovascular support, chrysanthemum with cooling and soothing effects, and cassia seeds with digestive and metabolic benefits. While it is sometimes recommended for hyperlipidemia management, its efficacy should be considered as part of a broader dietary and lifestyle approach rather than a standalone treatment.  \n\nThe tea is prepared by steeping the dried ingredients in hot water, and it is enjoyed both for its flavor and its potential wellness applications. As with any herbal remedy, consultation with a healthcare professional is advised, especially for those with pre-existing conditions or taking medications.  \n\n(Word count: 178)\",3\r\n2945,杞菊饮,\"杞菊饮是一种经验食养茶饮，由枸杞子、菊花、炒决明子、绿茶制作而成\"\"\",3\r\n2905,炒决明子,\"A medicinal ingredient (roasted cassia seed) used in teas\"\"\",3\r\n2120,CARDIA,CARDIA is a research organization that has conducted studies on weight management and metabolic syndrome control,1\r\n2121,绿茶,\"绿茶 is a type of tea rich in active substances like tea polyphenols, which have antioxidant and health benefits\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2112,菊花,高脂血症人群,菊花可以作为高脂血症人群的食药物质，辅助调节血脂,34\r\n2171,痰浊内阻型高脂血症食谱,山楂菊花决明子茶,山楂菊花决明子茶 is part of the dietary plan for managing hyperlipidemia,28\r\n2379,枸杞子,杞菊饮,枸杞子是杞菊饮的主要材料之一,19\r\n2384,炒决明子,山楂,炒决明子和山楂一起用于制作山楂菊花决明子茶,19\r\n1795,CARDIA,绿茶,Both CARDIA and绿茶 are mentioned in the context of health management and lifestyle improvements,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
