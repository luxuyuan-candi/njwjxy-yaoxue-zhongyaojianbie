Additionally, Japanese fishermen exhibit low rates of heart disease, a phenomenon linked to their high consumption of fish, a key component of the traditional Japanese diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Furthermore, studies from the International Consortium of Psychiatric Epidemiology (ICPE) suggest that Japan has a low lifetime prevalence of depression, possibly influenced by cultural, social, or lifestyle factors.
