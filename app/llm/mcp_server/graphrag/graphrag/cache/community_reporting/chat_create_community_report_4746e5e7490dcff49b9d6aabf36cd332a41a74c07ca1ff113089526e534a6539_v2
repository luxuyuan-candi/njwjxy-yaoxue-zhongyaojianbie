Primarily used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), it serves as a nourishing agent for blood and is often incorporated into herbal formulations to harmonize and enhance the effects of other herbs.  \n\nAs a dual-purpose **食药物质** (medicinal food), 大枣 is particularly recommended for conditions such as **气虚血瘀型高脂血症** (hyperlipidemia due to qi deficiency and blood stasis), where it helps regulate blood circulation and improve overall vitality. Its therapeutic applications extend to tonifying the spleen, calming the mind, and supporting digestive health.  \n\nIn culinary and medicinal practices, 大枣 is valued for its sweet flavor and versatility, commonly used in soups, teas, and herbal decoctions. Its integration into both dietary and therapeutic contexts underscores its significance in promoting holistic well-being in TCM.\",5\r\n2774,鸡肉,鸡肉 is a type of meat used in the recipe for its nutritional value,6\r\n3946,红花,\"**红花** is a traditional Chinese medicine ingredient primarily known for its ability to promote blood circulation. It is commonly used in herbal remedies to address conditions related to blood stasis or poor circulation. Additionally, **红花油 (honghua oil)**, derived from safflower (which may be associated with or confused with 红花 in some contexts), contains various unsaturated fatty acids such as linoleic acid, oleic acid, and linolenic acid. These compounds contribute to its potential health benefits, including the reduction of serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, thereby supporting cardiovascular health.  \n\nWhile **红花** is primarily recognized for its role in blood circulation, the oil derived from related plants (such as safflower) expands its applications to include lipid metabolism and heart health. This combination of properties makes **红花** and its derivatives valuable in both traditional and modern therapeutic contexts.  \n\n(Note: If \"\"红花油\"\" strictly refers to oil extracted from **红花** rather than safflower, the description would instead emphasize that **红花** itself yields an oil rich in unsaturated fatty acids with cholesterol-lowering effects. Clarification on the botanical source of the oil would refine the summary further.)  \n\nWord count: 149\",3\r\n2505,桃仁,\"**桃仁** is a traditional Chinese medicinal ingredient widely recognized for its health benefits, particularly in promoting blood circulation.

Its therapeutic applications stem from its ability to invigorate blood flow, resolve stasis, and alleviate related symptoms.
