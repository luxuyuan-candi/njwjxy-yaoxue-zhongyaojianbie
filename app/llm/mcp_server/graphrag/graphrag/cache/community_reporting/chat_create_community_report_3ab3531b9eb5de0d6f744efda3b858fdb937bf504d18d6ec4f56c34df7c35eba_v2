Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\r\n842,BMI,\"**BMI (Body Mass Index)** is a widely used measure that evaluates body weight relative to height, serving as an indicator of body fat and a tool for assessing obesity as a cardiovascular risk factor. Calculated using an individual's height and weight, BMI provides a standardized method to categorize weight status, helping healthcare professionals identify potential health risks associated with underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity. While BMI does not directly measure body fat, it is a practical and accessible screening tool for population-level health assessments. Its simplicity and consistency make it a common reference in clinical and public health settings, though it may not account for variations in muscle mass, bone density, or fat distribution among individuals. Overall, BMI remains a key metric for evaluating weight-related health risks.\",3\r\n843,EGFR,\"**EGFR (Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate)** is a clinical measure used to evaluate kidney function. It provides an estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which reflects how well the kidneys are filtering waste from the blood. eGFR is commonly employed to assess and stage chronic kidney disease (CKD), helping healthcare providers monitor disease progression and guide treatment decisions. Additionally, it is a valuable tool for evaluating kidney function in patients with hypertension, as hypertension can contribute to kidney damage over time. The term \"\"eGFR\"\" stands for \"\"estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate,\"\" emphasizing its role as an approximation rather than a direct measurement. Overall, eGFR serves as a key indicator of renal health across various clinical contexts.\",3\r\n845,CKD,\"**Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** is a medical condition characterized by the progressive loss of kidney function over time. It is categorized into stages based on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which measures how well the kidneys filter waste from the blood. CKD is also recognized as a significant risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), highlighting its broader impact on overall health. The condition requires careful management to mitigate complications, including cardiovascular risks, and often involves monitoring kidney function, dietary adjustments, and medical interventions to slow progression.\",2\r\n847,IMT,\"**IMT (Intima-Media Thickness)** is a medical measurement used to assess the thickness of the arterial wall, specifically the combined thickness of the intima and media layers. It serves as an important indicator for evaluating target organ damage, particularly in patients with hypertension. The measurement helps clinicians identify early signs of atherosclerosis or other vascular abnormalities, providing insights into cardiovascular health. Both descriptions agree on IMT's role in measuring arterial wall thickness and its clinical utility in hypertension-related assessments. No contradictions are present in the provided descriptions.  \n\n(Word count: 86)\",2\r\n846,LVMI,\"**LVMI (Left Ventricular Mass Index)** is a clinical measure used to assess the thickness of the left ventricular heart muscle, particularly in the context of evaluating left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). It serves as an important indicator of target organ damage, especially in patients with hypertension, helping clinicians gauge the impact of elevated blood pressure on cardiac structure. By standardizing left ventricular mass relative to body size, LVMI provides a more accurate assessment of heart muscle thickening compared to absolute measurements. This metric is widely utilized in cardiovascular diagnostics and risk stratification to guide treatment decisions and monitor disease progression.\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n533,BMI,EGFR,BMI and eGFR are both used in the evaluation of hypertension-related risks,6\r\n536,CKD,EGFR,Chronic Kidney Disease stages are determined by the Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate,5\r\n2358,IMT,EGFR,Both IMT and eGFR are measures used to assess cardiovascular and kidney health respectively,5\r\n537,LVMI,IMT,Left Ventricular Mass Index and Intima-Media Thickness are both measures of target organ damage in hypertension,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
