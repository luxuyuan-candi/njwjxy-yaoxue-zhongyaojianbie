They function by increasing the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain, two neurotransmitters associated with mood regulation. SNRIs are widely recognized as an effective pharmacological option for managing depressive disorders.  \n\nWhile SNRIs are commonly prescribed for depression, some studies suggest they may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous miscarriage, though further research is needed to fully understand this potential risk. The class is also referred to by alternative names, including \"\"Serotonin and Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors\"\" and \"\"Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors,\"\" all of which describe the same group of medications.  \n\nIn summary, SNRIs are a well-established class of antidepressants with a primary role in depression treatment, though their use may carry certain risks that warrant careful consideration, particularly in specific populations such as pregnant individuals.\",12\r\n5264,NASSA,\"Noradrenergic and Specific Serotonergic Antidepressants, a class of antidepressants\nNoradrenergic and Specific Serotonergic Antidepressants - a class of antidepressant medications\",4\r\n5265,TCAS,\"Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) are a traditional class of antidepressant medications historically used to treat depression but now primarily prescribed as a second-line treatment due to their side effect profile and the availability of newer alternatives. TCAs are known for their significant anticholinergic effects, which can cause dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and urinary retention, as well as their potential for cardiac toxicity, including arrhythmias and hypotension. These risks make them generally unsuitable for elderly patients, who are more vulnerable to such adverse effects.  \n\nDespite their drawbacks, TCAs remain an important option in certain cases, particularly when other treatments have failed. They work by inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine, though their mechanism is less selective than that of newer antidepressants such as SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors). While their use has declined in favor of safer alternatives, TCAs continue to be relevant in specific clinical scenarios, underscoring their enduring role in psychiatric treatment.  \n\nThe descriptions consistently highlight TCAs as a well-established but secondary option in modern antidepressant therapy, emphasizing their efficacy alongside their notable side effects and risks. No major contradictions exist among the provided descriptions, as all agree on their classification, historical significance, and current status as a second-line treatment.\",7\r\n5266,MAOIS,\"**MAOIs (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors)** are a traditional class of antidepressant medications used to treat depression. They work by inhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which breaks down neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, thereby increasing their availability in the brain. MAOIs are considered an older class of antidepressants but remain effective for certain patients, particularly those who do not respond to other treatments.  \n\nHowever, MAOIs have significant dietary and drug interaction restrictions. Notably, they should not be combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram, due to the risk of serotonin syndrome—a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin levels. Additionally, MAOIs require strict adherence to dietary guidelines to avoid interactions with tyramine-rich foods (e.g., aged cheeses, cured meats), which can lead to dangerous increases in blood pressure.  \n\nDespite these limitations, MAOIs remain a valuable option in psychiatric treatment, particularly for treatment-resistant depression. Their use is carefully monitored to ensure patient safety.\",6\r\n5270,NDRI,\"Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, a class of antidepressant medications\",1\r\n5281,MIRTAZAPINE,An antidepressant that may improve sleep in elderly patients but may be associated with spontaneous miscarriage risk,1\r\n5282,VENLAFAXINE,An SNRI antidepressant that requires blood pressure monitoring in elderly patients due to hypertensive effects,1\r\n4151,FDA,\"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a federal regulatory agency responsible for overseeing the safety, efficacy, and security of food, drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, and other consumer products in the United States.

For instance, in 2000, the FDA listed diacylglycerol oil as a GRAS substance, indicating its approval for use in food products based on scientific evidence. Additionally, the FDA assesses the safety of pharmaceuticals, such as antidepressants, and provides guidance on their use during pregnancy, categorizing them based on potential risks and benefits.
