It is often caused by dietary and lifestyle factors such as excessive alcohol consumption, high-fat diets, lack of exercise, and genetic predisposition. Poor management of these factors can lead to serious health complications, including pancreatitis, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and metabolic disorders. High lipidemia is also a significant global health concern, acting as a \"\"silent killer\"\" and a major contributor to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.  \n\nThe condition is typically managed through dietary adjustments, regular exercise, and medication. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), high lipidemia is classified under categories such as \"\"blood stasis,\"\" \"\"phlegm-dampness,\"\" and \"\"lipid turbidity.\"\" TCM views it as a deficiency-excess syndrome, where phlegm and stasis are the manifestations, while deficiency serves as the root cause.  \n\nGiven its association with multiple systemic health risks, early detection and intervention are crucial to prevent long-term complications. Lifestyle modifications, alongside medical treatment, play a key role in controlling lipid levels and reducing the risk of associated diseases.\",53\r\n2708,VEGETABLE OIL,Vegetable oil is a type of ingredient used in the meal plan,3\r\n2399,KIDNEY,\"In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the kidney is regarded as a vital organ that plays a central role in growth, development, and overall metabolic regulation. It is believed that the kidney's function naturally declines with age, and this deterioration can contribute to various metabolic disorders, including high lipidemia (elevated levels of lipids in the blood). The kidney's influence on high lipidemia is attributed to its role in governing fluid metabolism, where dysfunction may disrupt the balance of bodily fluids and lead to metabolic imbalances.  \n\nTCM theory emphasizes the interconnectedness of organ systems, and the kidney's decline is seen as a key factor in age-related health issues. By impairing fluid metabolism, kidney dysfunction can indirectly promote conditions like high lipidemia, highlighting its broader systemic impact beyond its conventional physiological roles. Thus, in TCM, maintaining kidney health is considered essential for preventing metabolic disorders and supporting overall well-being.  \n\nThis summary consolidates both descriptions, presenting a coherent view of the kidney's role in TCM without contradictions. The kidney's association with high lipidemia is framed as a consequence of its regulatory functions in growth, development, and fluid metabolism.\",2\r\n3523,MIDDLE-AGED MEN,,2\r\n2400,PHLEGM-DAMPNESS,\"A Traditional Chinese Medicine syndrome pattern associated with high lipidemia, characterized by obesity, heaviness, drowsiness, and sticky tongue coating\"\"\",1\r\n2401,BLOOD STASIS,\"A Traditional Chinese Medicine syndrome pattern associated with high lipidemia, characterized by chest pain, dark purple lips, and purple spots on the tongue\"\"\",1\r\n3411,PANCREATITIS,\"Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, which can be triggered by high lipidemia.\"\"\",1\r\n3412,GALLSTONES,\"Gallstones are hardened deposits in the gallbladder, often associated with high lipidemia.\"\"\",1\r\n3413,DEMENTIA,\"Dementia is a cognitive decline condition that may be influenced by high lipidemia through vascular damage.\"\"\",1\r\n3512,THYROID FUNCTION,\"Thyroid function refers to the activity of the thyroid gland, which can influence lipid metabolism and contribute to high lipidemia when impaired>\nEndocrine function that regulates metabolism; hypothyroidism can cause high lipid levels>\",1\r\n3517,THYROID FUNCTION DECLINE,\"Thyroid function decline is a condition that can cause high lipidemia.\"\"\",1\r\n3518,PEOPLE WITH FAMILY HISTORY,\"Individuals with family history of high lipidemia, coronary heart disease, or stroke are at higher risk of developing the condition.\"\"\",1\r\n3519,XANTHOMA PATIENTS,\"Patients with xanthomas (yellowish cholesterol deposits) are identified as high-risk for high lipidemia.\"\"\",1\r\n3520,OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE,\"Overweight or obese individuals are at higher risk of developing high lipidemia.\"\"\",1\r\n3521,DIABETES MELLITUS,\"A metabolic disorder that can cause secondary high lipidemia.\"\"\",1\r\n3522,HEPATIC DISEASES,\"Liver diseases that can cause secondary high lipidemia.\"\"\",1\r\n3553,ALCOHOLISM,Alcoholism is a factor associated with late-stage high lipidemia,1\r\n2398,SPLEEN,\"In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the **spleen** is a vital organ with key functions in nutrient metabolism and fluid regulation. It is primarily responsible for transforming and transporting nutrients extracted from food, a process essential for maintaining overall health. When the spleen functions optimally, it ensures proper digestion and distribution of nutrients throughout the body. However, dysfunction of the spleen can disrupt these processes, leading to metabolic imbalances.  \n\nOne significant consequence of spleen dysfunction is its contribution to **high lipidemia** (elevated levels of lipids in the blood). This occurs because the spleen's role in fluid metabolism and nutrient transformation is compromised, impairing the body's ability to properly process and regulate fats. In TCM theory, the spleen's inability to manage fluids and nutrients efficiently can result in the accumulation of dampness or phlegm, which further exacerbates lipid imbalances.  \n\nBoth descriptions emphasize the spleen's central role in metabolic health and its link to high lipidemia when impaired. The first highlights its influence on fluid metabolism, while the second underscores its broader responsibility in nutrient transformation and transport. Together, they present a coherent understanding of the spleen's function in TCM and its pathological implications when disrupted.  \n\nIn summary, the **spleen** in TCM is critical for maintaining metabolic harmony, and its dysfunction can lead to high lipidemia through impaired nutrient processing and fluid regulation.\",2\r\n3331,POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN,\"**Postmenopausal Women**  \n\nPostmenopausal women are identified as a high-risk group for developing lipid abnormalities, including hyperlipidemia, due to hormonal changes associated with menopause. The decline in estrogen levels during this stage contributes to an increased risk of cardiovascular conditions, particularly coronary heart disease. As a result, postmenopausal women are more susceptible to metabolic and cardiovascular disorders, necessitating closer monitoring of lipid profiles and preventive healthcare measures to mitigate these risks.  \n\nThis summary integrates both descriptions, highlighting the connection between hormonal changes, lipid metabolism, and cardiovascular health in postmenopausal women without contradiction. The combined information emphasizes their elevated risk for both hyperlipidemia and coronary heart disease, reinforcing the need for targeted medical attention.\",2\r\n2413,SOY PROTEIN,\"**SOY PROTEIN** is a plant-based protein source recognized for its cardiovascular and lipid-management benefits. It is particularly recommended for individuals with high lipidemia (elevated blood lipid levels) as part of dietary strategies to improve lipid profiles. Research highlights its role in reducing cardiovascular risk, with a daily intake of 25 grams suggested to achieve these health benefits.  \n\nSoy protein's efficacy in managing lipid levels has made it a valuable component of therapeutic diets for patients with lipid disorders. Its plant-derived nature also makes it a suitable option for those seeking non-animal protein sources. Overall, soy protein is endorsed for its dual role in supporting heart health and aiding in the dietary management of high lipidemia.  \n\n(Word count: 109)\",3\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n963,HYPERTENSION,PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE,Hypertension contributes to development of peripheral vascular disease,82\r\n2072,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,LIVER,\"**Summary of HIGH LIPIDEMIA and LIVER in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM):**  \n\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), liver dysfunction is closely linked to the development of **high lipidemia** (elevated blood lipids). The liver plays a critical role in regulating fluid metabolism, and its dysfunction can impair this process, leading to an accumulation of lipids in the bloodstream. Additionally, the liver is responsible for maintaining the smooth flow of **Qi (vital energy)** and emotional balance. When liver function is disrupted, it can cause stagnation of Qi and emotional disturbances, which further exacerbate metabolic imbalances, including high lipidemia.  \n\nThus, in TCM, high lipidemia is viewed as a condition influenced by the liver's inability to properly manage fluid metabolism and Qi circulation, as well as its role in emotional regulation. These interconnected mechanisms highlight the liver's central role in metabolic and energetic harmony, with dysfunction contributing to lipid imbalances.  \n\n*(Word count: 132)*\",74\r\n3572,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,VEGETABLE OIL,\"Vegetable oil is recommended to replace animal fats in the diet for high lipidemia patients\nVegetable oil is recommended to replace animal fats in high lipidemia diets\",56\r\n2074,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,KIDNEY,\"**Summary of HIGH LIPIDEMIA and KIDNEY in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM):**  \n\nIn Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the **kidney** is regarded as a vital organ whose dysfunction can lead to systemic metabolic disturbances, including **high lipidemia (elevated blood lipids)**. According to TCM principles, the kidney governs fluid metabolism and plays a central role in maintaining overall physiological balance. A decline in kidney function disrupts this balance, impairing the body's ability to regulate fluids and metabolic processes. This dysfunction can contribute to the development of **high lipidemia**, as improper fluid metabolism may lead to the accumulation of pathological dampness or phlegm, which in turn disrupts lipid metabolism.  \n\nThe two provided descriptions align in emphasizing the kidney's role in metabolic regulation, particularly its influence on lipid levels when impaired. While the first description broadly links **kidney decline** to metabolic disorders like **high lipidemia**, the second specifies that this occurs through disrupted **fluid metabolism**, further clarifying the mechanism. Together, these insights suggest that in TCM, **kidney dysfunction** is a key factor in the pathogenesis of **high lipidemia**, primarily due to its impact on fluid and metabolic homeostasis.  \n\nThus, in TCM theory, supporting kidney function may be considered an important approach in managing **high lipidemia** and related metabolic disorders. The connection underscores the holistic view of TCM, where organ systems are interdependent, and their dysfunction can manifest in systemic conditions.\",55\r\n3394,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,MIDDLE-AGED MEN,Middle-aged men are a high-risk group for developing high lipidemia,55\r\n2075,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,PHLEGM-DAMPNESS,Phlegm-dampness is one of the syndrome patterns of high lipidemia in TCM,54\r\n2076,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,BLOOD STASIS,Blood stasis is one of the syndrome patterns of high lipidemia in TCM,54\r\n3125,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,PANCREATITIS,High lipidemia can trigger pancreatitis.,54\r\n3126,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,GALLSTONES,High lipidemia is associated with the formation of gallstones.,54\r\n3129,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,DEMENTIA,High lipidemia may increase dementia risk via vascular damage to the brain.,54\r\n3375,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,THYROID FUNCTION,\"Impaired thyroid function can lead to high lipidemia by disrupting lipid metabolism\nHypothyroidism can cause secondary high lipidemia by slowing metabolism\",54\r\n3392,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,THYROID FUNCTION DECLINE,Thyroid function decline can cause high lipidemia,54\r\n3396,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,PEOPLE WITH FAMILY HISTORY,People with family history have higher risk of developing high lipidemia,54\r\n3397,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,XANTHOMA PATIENTS,Xanthoma patients are at high risk for high lipidemia,54\r\n3398,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,OVERWEIGHT PEOPLE,Overweight people are at higher risk for high lipidemia,54\r\n3400,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,DIABETES MELLITUS,Diabetes mellitus can cause secondary high lipidemia,54\r\n3401,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,HEPATIC DISEASES,Hepatic diseases can cause secondary high lipidemia,54\r\n3447,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,ALCOHOLISM,Alcoholism is a contributing factor to late-stage high lipidemia,54\r\n2866,SPLEEN,LIVER,\"In TCM, the spleen and liver work together in nutrient transformation and Qi regulation\",23\r\n2956,HIGH LIPID BLOOD DISEASE,POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN,Postmenopausal women are at increased risk for high lipid blood disease,12\r\n3574,SOY PROTEIN,VEGETABLE OIL,Both soy protein and vegetable oil are recommended plant-based alternatives in high lipidemia diets,6\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
