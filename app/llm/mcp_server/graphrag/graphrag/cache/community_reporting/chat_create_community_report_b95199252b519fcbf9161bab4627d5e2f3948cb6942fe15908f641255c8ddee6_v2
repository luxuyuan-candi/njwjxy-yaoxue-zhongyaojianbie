It is clinically used to lower triglycerides and cholesterol levels while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL), contributing to improved cardiovascular health. The formulation exhibits significant physiological activity in preventing atherosclerosis, inhibiting platelet aggregation, and delaying thrombus formation, thereby reducing the risk of thrombosis.  \n\nAs a therapeutic agent, 多烯康 combines lipid-regulating and anti-inflammatory properties, making it effective in managing hyperlipidemia and supporting vascular health. Its dual action on lipid metabolism and platelet function underscores its role in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. The preparation is widely recognized in China for its natural composition and evidence-based benefits in reducing cardiovascular risk factors.  \n\nIn summary, 多烯康 is a comprehensive fish oil-based treatment that addresses elevated triglycerides, cholesterol imbalances, and thrombotic tendencies, offering a multifaceted approach to cardiovascular protection.\",2\r\n2583,美国深海鱼油,\"美国深海鱼油 is an American fish oil product similar to 多烯康, but not strongly recommended by experts due to unproven efficacy and potential side effects\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1983,多烯康,高脂血症,多烯康用于治疗高脂血症，具有降低血脂的作用。,112\r\n1992,多烯康,美国深海鱼油,多烯康 and 美国深海鱼油 are similar fish oil preparations used for lipid management,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
