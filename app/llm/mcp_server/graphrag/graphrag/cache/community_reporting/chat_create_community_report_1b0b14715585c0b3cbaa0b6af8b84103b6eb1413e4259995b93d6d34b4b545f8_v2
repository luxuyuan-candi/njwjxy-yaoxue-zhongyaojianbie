It can affect individuals of any body weight and may exhibit seasonal variations. Hyperlipidemia is a significant global health concern due to its association with increased cardiovascular risks, particularly atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arteries) and coronary heart disease. Often referred to as a \"\"silent killer,\"\" the condition frequently goes undetected despite its role in raising the likelihood of serious cardiovascular events.  \n\nThe abnormal lipid levels in hyperlipidemia are a major risk factor for atherosclerosis, which can lead to narrowed or blocked arteries, increasing the chances of heart attacks and strokes. Additionally, hyperlipidemia often coexists with other health conditions, such as hypertension (high blood pressure), further compounding cardiovascular risks.  \n\nManagement of hyperlipidemia typically involves dietary and lifestyle modifications, such as reducing saturated fat intake, increasing physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight. In some cases, medication may be required to control lipid levels effectively. Given its silent nature, regular screening is recommended to detect and address the condition early, thereby mitigating its long-term health consequences.  \n\nIn summary, hyperlipidemia is a prevalent yet often undiagnosed condition marked by elevated blood lipids, posing significant risks for cardiovascular diseases.
