After meals, they are transported in **chylomicrons**, while during fasting, they circulate in **very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL)**. Triglycerides are stored as **subcutaneous fat**, providing a reserve of energy for metabolic needs.  \n\nNormal triglyceride levels vary by sex: for **males**, the range is **0.45–1.81 mmol/L (40–160 mg/dL)**, and for **females**, it is **0.23–1.2 mmol/L (20–108 mg/dL)**. These levels are important indicators of metabolic health, with elevated concentrations potentially linked to cardiovascular risks.  \n\nIn summary, triglycerides play a dual role as both an **immediate energy source** and a **long-term energy reserve**, while their levels in the blood are closely monitored to assess overall health.\",17\r\n2192,FAMILIAL HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA,\"**FAMILIAL HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA** is a genetic disorder characterized by elevated serum triglyceride levels. It is an inherited condition that results in abnormally high concentrations of triglycerides in the blood, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications. The two provided descriptions are consistent, both emphasizing the genetic basis of the disorder and its primary clinical manifestation—elevated triglyceride levels. No contradictions are present in the descriptions. Familial hypertriglyceridemia is typically passed down through families and may require lifestyle modifications or medical interventions to manage triglyceride levels and mitigate associated health risks.  \n\n(Word count: 94)\",3\r\n2188,NEPHROTIC SYNDROME,\"**Nephrotic Syndrome** is a kidney disorder characterized by significant proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. It is also associated with metabolic disturbances, including dyslipidemia. The condition can lead to elevated serum triglyceride levels due to increased hepatic lipoprotein synthesis and decreased lipid clearance. Additionally, nephrotic syndrome is recognized as a contributing factor in the development of late-stage hyperlipidemia, exacerbating lipid abnormalities over time. These lipid metabolism disruptions further complicate the clinical management of the syndrome, often necessitating targeted therapeutic interventions to address both renal and metabolic aspects of the disease.  \n\nIn summary, nephrotic syndrome not only impairs kidney function but also significantly impacts lipid metabolism, leading to elevated triglycerides and contributing to progressive hyperlipidemia in advanced stages.\",2\r\n2189,HYPOTHYROIDISM,\"**Hypothyroidism** is a medical condition characterized by an underactive thyroid gland, which results in insufficient production of thyroid hormones. This endocrine disorder is often associated with metabolic disturbances, including elevated serum triglyceride levels, which can contribute to lipid metabolism imbalances. Additionally, hypothyroidism is recognized as a contributing factor in the development of late-stage **high lipidemia** (hyperlipidemia), a condition marked by abnormally high levels of lipids in the blood. The interplay between hypothyroidism and lipid metabolism underscores the importance of thyroid function in maintaining overall metabolic health.  \n\nIn summary, hypothyroidism not only involves reduced thyroid hormone production but also has significant implications for lipid regulation, potentially exacerbating conditions like hyperlipidemia. Proper management of thyroid function is essential to mitigate associated metabolic complications.\",2\r\n2185,CHYLOMICRONS,Chylomicrons are lipoprotein particles that transport triglycerides from the intestines to other parts of the body after meals,1\r\n2191,CUSHING SYNDROME,A hormonal disorder that can cause elevated serum triglyceride levels,1\r\n2194,GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE,\"**GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE** is a metabolic disorder characterized by the abnormal storage or release of glycogen, leading to various biochemical imbalances. One of the key manifestations of this condition is elevated serum triglyceride levels, which can contribute to metabolic complications. The descriptions provided consistently highlight this feature, emphasizing the disorder's impact on lipid metabolism.  \n\nIn summary, GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE disrupts normal glycogen metabolism and is associated with increased triglyceride levels in the blood, posing potential risks for related health issues. The descriptions align without contradiction, reinforcing the disorder's metabolic nature and its effects on triglyceride regulation.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1517,TRIGLYCERIDES,FAMILIAL HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA,Elevated serum triglyceride levels are associated with familial hypertriglyceridemia,20\r\n1512,TRIGLYCERIDES,NEPHROTIC SYNDROME,Elevated serum triglyceride levels are associated with nephrotic syndrome,19\r\n1514,TRIGLYCERIDES,HYPOTHYROIDISM,Elevated serum triglyceride levels are associated with hypothyroidism,19\r\n1509,TRIGLYCERIDES,CHYLOMICRONS,Triglycerides are transported in chylomicrons after meals,18\r\n1516,TRIGLYCERIDES,CUSHING SYNDROME,Elevated serum triglyceride levels are associated with Cushing syndrome,18\r\n1519,TRIGLYCERIDES,GLYCOGEN STORAGE DISEASE,Elevated serum triglyceride levels are associated with glycogen storage disease,18\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
