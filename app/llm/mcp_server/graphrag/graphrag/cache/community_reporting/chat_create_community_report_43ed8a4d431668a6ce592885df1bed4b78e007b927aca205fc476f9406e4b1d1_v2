These institutions play a pivotal role in preventive care and long-term health management, particularly for conditions such as hypertension and dyslipidemia (abnormal blood lipid levels).  \n\nA key responsibility of 社区卫生服务机构 is the formation of general practitioner teams tasked with comprehensive community health initiatives. These teams conduct screenings, diagnoses, and risk assessments for coexisting hypertension and dyslipidemia, identifying critical conditions and providing pre-hospital emergency care when necessary. Additionally, they implement stratified management and regular follow-ups to monitor patient progress.  \n\nFurthermore, 社区卫生服务机构 oversee the coordinated care of patients with coexisting hypertension and dyslipidemia, facilitating bidirectional referrals (between primary and specialized care) and ensuring continuity through systematic follow-up management. By integrating screening, risk evaluation, emergency response, and ongoing patient supervision, these institutions enhance community health outcomes and reduce the burden on higher-level healthcare facilities.  \n\nIn summary, 社区卫生服务机构 serve as essential hubs for public health, chronic disease management, and community-based care, with a focus on early detection, risk mitigation, and sustained patient support.

It utilizes internationally certified ambulatory blood pressure monitors that undergo regular calibration to ensure accuracy. ABPM is particularly useful for diagnosing conditions such as white-coat hypertension (elevated blood pressure in clinical settings), masked hypertension (normal blood pressure in clinics but elevated elsewhere), and nocturnal hypertension (abnormally high blood pressure during sleep).  \n\nThe monitoring process involves taking measurements at regular intervals—typically every 15-20 minutes during waking hours and every 30 minutes during sleep. To ensure reliability, valid readings must cover at least 80% of the total monitoring duration, with a minimum of 20 daytime readings and 7 nighttime readings. ABPM provides comprehensive data, including average systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure values over a 24-hour period, as well as separate averages for daytime (awake) and nighttime (sleep) periods.  \n\nBy offering continuous, real-world blood pressure assessment, ABPM helps clinicians make more accurate diagnoses and tailor treatment plans for patients with hypertension-related conditions. Its ability to capture fluctuations over a full day makes it a valuable tool in cardiovascular health management.\",4\r\n830,HBPM,\"**Summary of HBPM (Home Blood Pressure Monitoring):**  \n\nHBPM (Home Blood Pressure Monitoring) is a widely used method for monitoring blood pressure, particularly in hypertensive patients. It serves multiple purposes, including identifying conditions such as white coat hypertension, masked hypertension, and resistant hypertension, as well as evaluating long-term blood pressure variability, assessing the efficacy of antihypertensive treatments, and predicting cardiovascular risk and prognosis. The diagnostic threshold for hypertension via HBPM is an average systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥135 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥85 mmHg.  \n\nHBPM can be performed by patients themselves or with the assistance of family members, making it a flexible and accessible tool for self-measured or home-based blood pressure assessment. It plays a significant role in enhancing patient health awareness, improving treatment adherence, and facilitating long-term blood pressure management. Additionally, HBPM is recognized as both a self-management tool for patients and an auxiliary diagnostic method for hypertension.  \n\nWith advancements in telemetry technology, internet-based remote HBPM and management systems are emerging as potential future models for blood pressure control. However, further research is needed to validate their effectiveness and health economic benefits. Despite its advantages, improper use of self-monitoring devices—including wearables—may lead to excessive focus on blood pressure, frequent measurements, and fluctuations, which could negatively impact patient well-being.  \n\nIn summary, HBPM is a valuable tool for general hypertension monitoring, offering diagnostic, prognostic, and self-management benefits while requiring proper implementation to maximize its advantages.\",6\r\n832,DBP,\"Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) is a key metric in blood pressure monitoring, with diagnostic thresholds for hypertension set at ≥85 mmHg for HBPM and specific averages for ABPM.\",3\r\n609,全科医生,全科医生是基层医疗团队的重要成员，在高血压和血脂异常的联合管理中发挥着核心作用。他们负责为高血压和血脂异常共存的居民建立健康档案，全面评估患者的疾病状况、心理状态及营养问题，并协调多学科团队会诊工作，确保患者获得综合性的诊疗服务。此外，全科医生还根据患者的具体情况，推荐个体化的治疗方案，以优化治疗效果并提升健康管理水平。通过上述职责，全科医生在基层医疗中承担了预防、诊断、治疗和长期健康管理的多重角色，为居民提供连续、协调且高效的医疗服务。,6\r\n610,院内药师,院内药师结合患者病史与用药史，提供用药咨询和用药指导,2\r\n611,发热儿童严重疾病警示分级评估,发热儿童严重疾病警示分级评估是一种用于评估儿童发热严重程度的系统,2\r\n831,SBP,\"Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) is a key metric in blood pressure monitoring, with diagnostic thresholds for hypertension set at ≥135 mmHg for HBPM and specific averages for ABPM.\",4\r\n1351,高血压和血脂异常共存患者,\"高血压和血脂异常共存患者是社区卫生服务机构的主要管理对象，需要进行健康档案建立、评估、治疗和随访管理\"\"\",1\r\n844,TIA,\"TIA refers to transient ischemic attack, a clinical condition related to hypertension\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n936,分级管理小组,社区卫生服务机构,分级管理小组由社区卫生服务机构建立并授权管理,12\r\n930,社区卫生服务机构,医联体,社区卫生服务机构 collaborates with hospitals to form medical alliances (医联体),11\r\n931,社区卫生服务机构,医共体,社区卫生服务机构 collaborates with hospitals to form medical consortia (医共体),11\r\n932,社区卫生服务机构,多学科团队,多学科团队 works with 社区卫生服务机构 for comprehensive patient care,11\r\n937,社区卫生服务机构,双向转诊,社区卫生服务机构负责执行双向转诊流程,11\r\n998,社区卫生服务机构,上级综合医院或专科医院,社区卫生服务机构与上级综合医院或专科医院协同开展全科-专科协同的临床诊治与健康管理,11\r\n999,社区卫生服务机构,社区药房,社区药房与社区卫生服务机构上下联动，形成社区医院与社会药店的服务体系,11\r\n1000,社区卫生服务机构,街道办事处和社区工作站,街道办事处和社区工作站与社区卫生服务机构合作建立卫生健康联防联控机制,11\r\n520,ABPM,HBPM,\"**Summary of ABPM and HBPM**  \n\nABPM (Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring) and HBPM (Home Blood Pressure Monitoring) are two methods used to measure and monitor blood pressure outside of a clinical setting. Both techniques serve as valuable tools for assessing blood pressure in real-world environments, providing more comprehensive data than single clinic readings.  \n\nABPM involves wearing a portable device that automatically records blood pressure at regular intervals over a 24-hour period, offering insights into fluctuations throughout daily activities and sleep. HBPM, on the other hand, relies on patients measuring their own blood pressure at home using a validated device, typically following a structured schedule.  \n\nThese methods are commonly employed to confirm diagnoses such as resistant hypertension, where blood pressure remains elevated despite treatment. Additionally, they help detect white-coat hypertension (elevated readings in clinical settings only) and masked hypertension (normal readings in clinics but elevated elsewhere). By providing a more accurate representation of a patient's blood pressure patterns, ABPM and HBPM assist healthcare providers in making informed treatment decisions.  \n\nWhile the descriptions provided are largely consistent, they collectively emphasize that both ABPM and HBPM serve the dual purpose of **confirming hypertension diagnoses** and **ongoing blood pressure monitoring** outside the clinic. The repeated mention of their role in non-clinical settings underscores their importance in improving diagnostic accuracy and long-term management of hypertension.  \n\nIn summary, ABPM and HBPM are complementary techniques that enhance blood pressure assessment by capturing real-world measurements, aiding in both diagnosis and continuous monitoring for better patient care.\",10\r\n521,HBPM,ABPM,\"Both HBPM and ABPM are methods for monitoring blood pressure outside the clinic, with HBPM focusing on home measurements and ABPM on 24-hour ambulatory monitoring.\",10\r\n523,HBPM,DBP,HBPM uses DBP (≥85 mmHg) as one of its diagnostic criteria for hypertension.,9\r\n325,全科医生,院内药师,全科医生和院内药师共同参与患者的治疗方案制定,8\r\n326,全科医生,发热儿童严重疾病警示分级评估,全科医生可能使用发热儿童严重疾病警示分级评估来诊断患者,8\r\n535,SBP,DBP,\"**Summary of SBP and DBP:**  \n\nSystolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) are both key measures of blood pressure used in the diagnosis and assessment of hypertension risk.
