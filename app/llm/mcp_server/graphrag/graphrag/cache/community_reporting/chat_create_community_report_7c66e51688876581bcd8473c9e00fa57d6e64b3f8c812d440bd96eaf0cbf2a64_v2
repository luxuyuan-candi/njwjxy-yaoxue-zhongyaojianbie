This discrepancy can be detected through methods such as Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) or Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM). The condition highlights the importance of measuring blood pressure outside of medical environments to accurately diagnose and manage hypertension in affected individuals.,3\n936,ABPM,\"**ABPM (Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring)** is a clinical method used to measure blood pressure dynamically over a 24-hour period, including during daily activities and sleep. It serves as a standard diagnostic tool for various hypertension-related conditions, such as **white-coat hypertension**, **morning hypertension**, **nighttime hypertension**, and **masked hypertension** (隐蔽性高血压). ABPM helps identify abnormal blood pressure fluctuations, including irregularities in circadian rhythms, such as elevated nighttime or early-morning blood pressure. By providing automated, continuous measurements, ABPM enables healthcare providers to assess blood pressure patterns more accurately than isolated clinic readings, making it a critical tool in hypertension management and diagnosis.  \n\nThe method is particularly valuable for detecting conditions that may be missed in traditional office settings, such as **white-coat hypertension** (where blood pressure is elevated only in clinical environments) and **nighttime hypertension** (abnormally high blood pressure during sleep). Additionally, ABPM aids in evaluating **morning hypertension**, a risk factor for cardiovascular events. Its comprehensive 24-hour monitoring allows for a more precise assessment of blood pressure behavior, contributing to better-informed treatment decisions.  \n\n(Note: The Chinese description provided—\"\"动态血压监测有助于发现异常血压波动、夜间或清晨高血压等血压节律失常，评估白大衣性高血压和隐蔽性高血压\"\"—has been incorporated into the summary, reinforcing ABPM's role in detecting blood pressure rhythm abnormalities and specific hypertension subtypes.)\",19\n943,WHITE-COAT HYPERTENSION,,2\n953,NOCTURNAL BLOOD PRESSURE,Nocturnal blood pressure refers to nighttime blood pressure patterns that help assess cardiovascular risk,2\n938,中国动态血压监测指南,\"The 'Chinese Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Guidelines' provide detailed methods for ABPM, standardizing its clinical application and promoting its use in community health centers.\"\"\",1\n940,COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS,\"Healthcare facilities where ABPM is being implemented for standardized hypertension diagnosis and management\"\"\",1\n941,REMOTE DYNAMIC DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM,\"Technology platform enabling standardized ABPM analysis and reporting, facilitating clinical applications\"\"\",1\n937,HBPM,\"**HBPM (Home Blood Pressure Monitoring)** is a method used by patients to measure their own blood pressure in their familiar home environment, outside of clinical settings.
