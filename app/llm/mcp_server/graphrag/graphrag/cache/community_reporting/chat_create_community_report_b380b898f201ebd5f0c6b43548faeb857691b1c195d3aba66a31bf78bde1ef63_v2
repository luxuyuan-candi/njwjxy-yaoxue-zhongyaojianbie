This condition significantly increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events, including heart attacks, strokes, and other complications. ASCVD is the leading cause of death among urban and rural residents in China, accounting for over 40% of fatalities.  \n\nASCVD risk is assessed through stratification methods, categorizing individuals as low, medium, or high risk based on factors such as smoking, low HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), age, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. This risk assessment is particularly important for Chinese adults, guiding management strategies that include lifestyle interventions (e.g., diet, exercise) and medication, such as statins and PCSK9 inhibitors for high-risk patients.  \n\nThe condition is closely linked to lipid abnormalities, with lipid-lowering treatments being a primary therapeutic approach. Key biomarkers like ApoB (apolipoprotein B) and LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) are used to predict ASCVD risk and determine target values for patients, especially those with comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes. Regular lipid monitoring is essential for prevention and treatment.  \n\nASCVD is also referred to as **Arteriosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease**, emphasizing its association with cholesterol levels and overall cardiovascular health. While terminology may vary slightly, the core definition remains consistent: a progressive disease driven by plaque accumulation, necessitating proactive risk assessment and targeted therapies to mitigate adverse outcomes.  \n\nIn summary, ASCVD is a major global health concern, requiring comprehensive risk evaluation, lipid management, and tailored interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality.\",49\r\n1149,LDL-C,\"**LDL-C (Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol)** is a type of cholesterol commonly referred to as \"\"bad cholesterol\"\" due to its strong association with cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is a key lipid parameter used in assessing cardiovascular risk, particularly in hypertensive patients and those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). LDL-C contributes to the buildup of plaque in arteries, a process known as atherosclerosis, which heightens the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other CVD-related complications.  \n\nAs a primary target for lipid-lowering therapies, LDL-C is central to managing and reducing cardiovascular risk. Various drugs, including statins and other lipid-lowering agents, are designed to lower LDL-C levels in patients with elevated concentrations. Its role in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health makes it a critical focus in both clinical practice and preventive medicine.  \n\nIn summary, LDL-C is a well-established biomarker for cardiovascular risk, a major contributor to arterial plaque formation, and a principal target for therapeutic interventions aimed at improving lipid profiles and reducing CVD morbidity and mortality.\",40\r\n1165,CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE,,5\r\n4516,MIXED HYPERLIPIDEMIA,\"**MIXED HYPERLIPIDEMIA**  \n\nMixed hyperlipidemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by the concurrent elevation of both cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. This condition is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) due to the combined effects of high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Management typically requires a combination of pharmacological therapies, as single-agent treatments may not adequately address both lipid abnormalities. The disorder underscores the importance of comprehensive lipid-lowering strategies to mitigate cardiovascular risks.  \n\nThe two provided descriptions align in their definition of mixed hyperlipidemia as a dual elevation of cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as its clinical implications for ASCVD risk. Both also emphasize the necessity of combination drug therapy for effective management, reinforcing the complexity of treating this condition.

It functions by helping to remove other forms of cholesterol, such as LDL (low-density lipoprotein), from the bloodstream and arteries, thereby reducing the risk of plaque buildup and cardiovascular diseases like atherosclerosis (ASCVD).  \n\nWhile HDL-C is generally considered beneficial, it can also serve as a cardiovascular risk factor in certain populations, such as hypertensive patients, where its levels may influence disease progression. Clinically, HDL-C is monitored as part of lipid profiling to assess overall cardiovascular health, with higher levels typically associated with reduced risk. However, its role in ASCVD risk assessment underscores that its impact may vary depending on individual health conditions.  \n\nIn summary, HDL-C is a key biomarker known for its cholesterol-removing properties, often linked to improved heart health, but its interpretation may differ based on specific medical contexts.\",7\r\n1148,TC,\"**Summary of TC (Total Cholesterol):**  \n\nTC, or Total Cholesterol, is a key measure used to assess lipid levels in the blood and plays a significant role in evaluating cardiovascular health. It is a well-established biomarker for cardiovascular risk, particularly in hypertensive patients, and is routinely monitored as part of lipid profiling for cardiovascular risk assessment. Total cholesterol serves as a baseline measurement in the evaluation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, helping clinicians identify individuals who may benefit from lifestyle modifications or medical interventions.  \n\nAs a single, coherent metric, TC provides insight into overall cholesterol levels, encompassing both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, along with other lipid components. Elevated TC levels are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, making it a critical parameter in preventive healthcare. By integrating TC into broader risk assessment models, medical professionals can better stratify patients and guide treatment decisions to mitigate long-term cardiovascular complications.  \n\nIn summary, TC (Total Cholesterol) is a fundamental lipid parameter used in clinical practice to assess cardiovascular risk, particularly in high-risk populations such as hypertensive patients, and serves as a foundational element in ASCVD risk evaluation.\",4\r\n3003,胆固醇吸收抑制剂,\"**Cholesterol Absorption Inhibitors**  \n\nCholesterol absorption inhibitors are a class of drugs primarily used as adjunct therapy in combination with statins when statin monotherapy fails to achieve target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. These inhibitors work by reducing the intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol, thereby complementing the mechanism of statins, which primarily inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver.  \n\nThe primary clinical application of cholesterol absorption inhibitors is to enhance LDL-C reduction in patients who do not reach their treatment goals with statins alone. By combining these two drug classes, a synergistic effect is achieved, leading to improved lipid management. This approach is particularly beneficial for individuals with hypercholesterolemia or those at high risk of cardiovascular disease.  \n\nWhile the descriptions emphasize their role in combination therapy, they consistently highlight that cholesterol absorption inhibitors are not typically used as standalone treatments but rather as supplementary agents to optimize cholesterol-lowering regimens. Their use is well-supported in clinical guidelines for patients requiring additional LDL-C reduction beyond what statins alone can provide.  \n\nIn summary, cholesterol absorption inhibitors serve as an effective adjunct to statin therapy, offering a dual mechanism to manage elevated LDL-C levels and improve cardiovascular outcomes. Their role is firmly established in cases where statin monotherapy proves insufficient.\",2\r\n3004,脂必泰,\"Zhibitai, a Chinese herbal compound containing red yeast rice for cholesterol reduction\"\"\",1\r\n3256,VLDL,\"**VLDL (Very Low-Density Lipoprotein)** is a triglyceride-rich lipoprotein that plays a key role in lipid metabolism. It is produced primarily by the liver and serves as a carrier for triglycerides, cholesterol, and other lipids through the bloodstream to peripheral tissues. While VLDL is essential for transporting energy in the form of triglycerides, elevated levels can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of plaques in arterial walls, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Thus, VLDL has a dual function: it is both a critical component of normal lipid metabolism and a potential contributor to vascular pathology when present in excessive amounts.  \n\nThe two provided descriptions highlight these contrasting aspects—VLDL's physiological role in lipid transport and its pathological association with atherosclerosis—without direct contradiction. Instead, they complement each other to present a comprehensive understanding of VLDL's functions and implications for health.\",8\r\n4543,SMALL INTERFERING RNA DRUGS,Small interfering RNA drugs are a newer class of medications that target specific genes to lower cholesterol levels>,1\r\n4545,ROSUVASTATIN,A high-intensity statin medication used to lower LDL-C levels>,1\r\n4546,PITAVASTATIN,A moderate-intensity statin medication>,1\r\n4547,XUEZHIKANG,\"**Xuezhikang** is a medical product discussed in the Chinese expert consensus as a traditional Chinese medicine extract primarily used for lipid management. It is recognized for its therapeutic potential in regulating lipid levels, aligning with both traditional practices and modern medical applications. The consensus highlights its role as an evidence-based treatment option, bridging traditional herbal medicine with contemporary clinical use. Xuezhikang's formulation leverages natural extracts to address dyslipidemia, offering a complementary or alternative approach to conventional lipid-lowering therapies. Its inclusion in expert guidelines underscores its efficacy and safety profile as a standardized herbal remedy.\",1\r\n4840,3B 研究 (3B STUDY),\"A study highlighting the prevalence of comorbidities like hypertension and dyslipidemia among Chinese diabetic patients\"\"\",4\r\n1993,DYSLIPIDEMIA,\"**DYSLIPIDEMIA**  \n\nDyslipidemia is a disorder of lipid metabolism characterized by abnormal levels of lipids in the blood, including elevated cholesterol and/or triglycerides. It is diagnosed through measurements of cholesterol (such as LDL, HDL) and triglyceride levels. The condition is a significant risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and is frequently associated with other comorbidities, particularly hypertension. Dyslipidemia often coexists with hypertension, emphasizing the need for integrated management of both conditions to reduce cardiovascular risk.  \n\nThe disorder is commonly observed in elderly patients, who may present with multiple metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. Dyslipidemia involves disruptions in lipoprotein metabolism, contributing to its classification as a major contributor to cardiovascular disease. Management typically focuses on lipid-lowering strategies, including lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions, to mitigate associated risks.  \n\nWhile descriptions vary slightly in emphasis—some highlighting its diagnostic criteria, others its association with hypertension or cardiovascular risk—the core definition remains consistent: Dyslipidemia is an abnormal lipid profile requiring medical attention to prevent complications, particularly in high-risk populations. The condition underscores the importance of regular screening and proactive management in patients with or at risk for metabolic and cardiovascular disorders.\",13\r\n743,NATIONAL MEDICAL PRODUCTS ADMINISTRATION,The National Medical Products Administration provides a list of OTC drug indications,2\r\n991,CHINESE GENERAL PRACTICE,\"**Chinese General Practice** is a medical journal that serves as a key resource for healthcare professionals, particularly in the field of general practice.

The journal has contributed to lipid management and treatment by providing evidence-based guidelines, including those related to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Additionally, it has featured studies on diagnostic approaches, such as the Murtagh diagnostic strategy, which aids practitioners in improving patient care.  \n\nAs a reputable publication, **Chinese General Practice** bridges research and practical application, offering insights into both treatment protocols and diagnostic methodologies. Its focus spans a range of topics relevant to primary care, ensuring that practitioners have access to up-to-date, actionable information. The journal’s role in disseminating ASCVD guidelines underscores its commitment to advancing cardiovascular health, while its inclusion of diagnostic research highlights its broader mission to enhance clinical practice.  \n\nIn summary, **Chinese General Practice** is a comprehensive medical journal dedicated to supporting general practitioners through research, guidelines, and innovative diagnostic strategies, with a notable emphasis on lipid management and cardiovascular care.\",6\r\n2131,CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT,The ongoing medical care and lifestyle interventions for long-term conditions like hypertension and dyslipidemia,6\r\n3010,海博麦布,海博麦布（HaiBo MaiBu）是一种国产自主研发的胆固醇吸收抑制剂，其作用机制与依折麦布（ezetimibe）相似。该药物为口服用药，常规用法为每日一次，每次10 mg。海博麦布通过抑制肠道内胆固醇的吸收，有效降低血液中的胆固醇水平，适用于高胆固醇血症等脂质代谢异常疾病的治疗。作为国内开发的药物，海博麦布为患者提供了更多治疗选择，并展现了国产创新药物在心血管疾病领域的发展潜力。,4\r\n2077,PCSK9,\"**PCSK9 (Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9)** is a protein that plays a key role in cholesterol metabolism and is primarily targeted by inhibitors to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. These inhibitors, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, are used in lipid-lowering treatments, particularly for patients with extremely high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who cannot tolerate other cholesterol-lowering medications. By binding to PCSK9, these inhibitors prevent the degradation of LDL receptors, thereby enhancing the liver's ability to remove LDL-C from the bloodstream. PCSK9 inhibitors represent an important therapeutic option for managing elevated cholesterol levels in high-risk populations. The protein itself is a proprotein convertase, and its inhibition has been shown to significantly reduce LDL-C, contributing to improved cardiovascular outcomes. Overall, PCSK9 serves as a critical target for pharmacological interventions aimed at lowering cholesterol and mitigating cardiovascular risk.\",11\r\n2078,依折麦布,\"**依折麦布（Ezetimibe）**是一种降脂药物，属于胆固醇吸收抑制剂，通过抑制肠道对胆固醇的吸收来降低血液中的胆固醇水平。它既可以单独使用，也可以与低剂量他汀类药物或血脂康（Xuezhikang）联合使用，适用于无法耐受标准治疗的患者。  \n\n依折麦布的作用机制独特，不诱导肝脏CYP450酶系统，因此不会影响其他药物的药代动力学特性，减少了药物间相互作用的风险。这一特性使其在联合用药时更具安全性，尤其适合需要多种药物治疗的患者。  \n\n综上所述，依折麦布是一种高效且安全的降脂药物，适用于单药治疗或联合用药方案，尤其适合对他汀类药物不耐受的患者，同时因其不干扰肝脏代谢酶的特点，在临床应用中具有较高的灵活性。\",5\r\n4518,APOA,Apolipoprotein A gene involved in lipid metabolism,4\r\n2042,APOB,\"**APOB (Apolipoprotein B)** is a protein encoded by the *APOB* gene, primarily involved in lipid metabolism and transport. It plays a critical role in the formation and function of lipoproteins, which are essential for transporting cholesterol and triglycerides in the bloodstream. APOB interacts with **microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)**, facilitating the assembly and secretion of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons.  \n\nAs a key component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), APOB is widely used in **cardiovascular risk assessment**, as elevated levels are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. The protein exists in two major forms: **APOB-100**, synthesized in the liver and integral to LDL and VLDL, and **APOB-48**, produced in the intestine and essential for chylomicron formation.  \n\nIn summary, APOB is a multifunctional protein central to lipid metabolism, lipoprotein assembly, and cardiovascular health, with its gene playing a regulatory role in these processes. Its interaction with MTP and its utility in risk stratification underscore its biological and clinical significance.\",11\r\n2043,LP(A),\"**Summary of LP(A):**  \n\nLP(A), or Lipoprotein(a), is a lipoprotein structurally similar to LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Elevated levels of LP(A) are recognized as an independent genetic risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and other cardiovascular conditions. Unlike other lipoproteins, LP(A)'s association with cardiovascular risk is largely determined by genetics, making it a significant biomarker for assessing inherited predisposition to heart disease.  \n\nResearch indicates that high LP(A) levels contribute to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing the likelihood of heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral artery disease. Due to its genetic basis, LP(A) levels remain relatively stable throughout a person’s life and are not easily influenced by lifestyle changes, unlike LDL-C. This underscores the importance of screening for LP(A) in individuals with a family history of premature cardiovascular disease.  \n\nIn summary, LP(A) is a unique, genetically influenced lipoprotein that independently elevates cardiovascular risk, warranting clinical attention for early detection and risk stratification.\",3\r\n2154,NON HDL-C,\"Non HDL-C is a secondary lipid control target for patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia, with specific target values based on patient risk levels\",3\r\n4572,MK?0616,\"MK?0616 is a novel oral PCSK9 inhibitor that lowers LDL-C levels by inhibiting PCSK9 binding to LDL-R, with good efficacy and safety shown in phase 2b clinical trials>\",2\r\n4515,CONSENSUS WRITING EXPERT GROUP,\"A multidisciplinary group from cardiology, general practice, geriatrics, traditional Chinese medicine, pharmacy, and epidemiology that developed the 2024 Chinese expert consensus on mixed hyperlipidemia management\",4\r\n4517,LDL?R,Low-density lipoprotein receptor gene involved in lipid metabolism and associated with hyperlipidemia risk,8\r\n4520,APOE,Apolipoprotein E gene involved in lipid metabolism,4\r\n4575,CRISPR?CAS,\"CRISPR-Cas is a gene editing technology that can permanently inhibit disease-causing genes, offering new possibilities for lipid-lowering therapy>\",1\r\n4522,INSULIN RESISTANCE,A metabolic condition that contributes to mixed hyperlipidemia by affecting lipid metabolism pathways,3\r\n4521,LPL,Lipoprotein lipase gene involved in lipid metabolism,2\r\n2044,CVD,\"CVD stands for Cardiovascular Disease, a broad term for heart and blood vessel disorders\"\"\",4\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1689,ASCVD,LDL-C,\"**Comprehensive Summary of ASCVD and LDL-C:**  \n\nAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk assessment and management heavily rely on evaluating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, as LDL-C is a well-established pathogenic risk factor for ASCVD. LDL-C serves as both a primary biomarker and a key intervention target in ASCVD risk stratification and prevention.  \n\nClinical guidelines emphasize the importance of LDL-C in diagnosing dyslipidemia, a major contributor to ASCVD. Risk stratification tools incorporate LDL-C measurements to determine individualized target values for patients, ensuring tailored therapeutic approaches. Elevated LDL-C levels are strongly associated with increased ASCVD risk, making their reduction a cornerstone of preventive strategies.  \n\nMultiple descriptions highlight the critical role of LDL-C in assessing and managing ASCVD risk, reinforcing its dual function as a diagnostic marker and a modifiable treatment target. By lowering LDL-C through lifestyle modifications or pharmacotherapy, clinicians can significantly mitigate ASCVD risk.  \n\nIn summary, LDL-C is integral to ASCVD risk evaluation, target setting, and intervention, underscoring its central role in cardiovascular disease prevention and management.\",89\r\n4574,CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE,HYPERTENSION,Hypertension can lead to or exacerbate chronic kidney disease,85\r\n4716,MIXED HYPERLIPIDEMIA,ASCVD,Mixed hyperlipidemia significantly increases risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,57\r\n3496,冠心病,冠状动脉旁路移植术,冠状动脉旁路移植术用于治疗冠心病,53\r\n4747,中国血脂管理指南（2023 年）,ASCVD,The guidelines provide risk stratification and treatment protocols for ASCVD prevention,52\r\n1728,ASCVD,RASI,RASI is recommended for patients with hypertension and high risk of ASCVD due to its effects on the renin-angiotensin system,51\r\n2451,ASCVD,血脂异常的临床分类,ASCVD risk is assessed through clinical classification of dyslipidemia,51\r\n1739,ASCVD,RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT),RCT research has demonstrated that combined antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy is crucial for ASCVD prevention,50\r\n2480,ASCVD,ARTERIOSCLEROTIC CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE,ARTERIOSCLEROTIC CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE is the full form of the acronym ASCVD,50\r\n2484,ASCVD,CABG,CABG is a treatment for severe ASCVD cases,50\r\n2488,ASCVD,CHINESE ADULTS,Chinese adults are the primary group for whom ASCVD risk assessment and management strategies are designed.,50\r\n2506,ASCVD,新发糖尿病,\"While statins may increase diabetes risk, their benefits for ASCVD prevention outweigh this risk\",50\r\n4735,ASCVD,SCORE CARDIOVASCULAR RISK SCALE,ASCVD risk can be assessed using the SCORE cardiovascular risk scale,50\r\n4736,ASCVD,CANADIAN CARDIOVASCULAR LIFE EXPECTANCY MODEL,ASCVD risk can be assessed using the Canadian cardiovascular life expectancy model,50\r\n4737,ASCVD,CORONARY ARTERY CALCIUM SCORE,ASCVD risk can be assessed using the coronary artery calcium score,50\r\n4738,ASCVD,US POOLED COHORT EQUATIONS,ASCVD risk can be assessed using the US pooled cohort equations,50\r\n4742,ASCVD,METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION-ASSOCIATED FATTY LIVER DISEASE,This liver condition exacerbates ASCVD risk via insulin resistance pathways,50\r\n4750,ASCVD,急性冠状动脉综合征,Acute coronary syndrome is a critical manifestation of ASCVD,50\r\n4752,ASCVD,经皮冠状动脉介入治疗,PCI is a standard revascularization procedure for ASCVD,50\r\n4754,PCI,ASCVD,PCI is a treatment for ASCVD,50\r\n4756,ASCVD,高敏C反应蛋白,Elevated hs-CRP indicates inflammatory ASCVD risk,50\r\n4757,ASCVD,冠状动脉钙化,Coronary calcium scoring predicts ASCVD risk,50\r\n4759,ASCVD,踝/臂血压指数,Low ABI indicates peripheral artery disease and ASCVD risk,50\r\n946,LDL-C,HDL-C,\"**LDL-C and HDL-C** are both cholesterol markers used in cardiovascular risk assessment, but they play opposing roles in cardiovascular health. **LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol)**, often referred to as \"\"bad\"\" cholesterol, contributes to the buildup of plaque in arteries, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, **HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol)**, known as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol, helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream, transporting it to the liver for excretion, thereby reducing cardiovascular risk.  \n\nThese two lipid markers are routinely measured together to provide a comprehensive evaluation of an individual's lipid profile and overall cardiovascular health. While **LDL-C** is associated with higher cardiovascular risk when elevated, **HDL-C** is considered protective, with higher levels generally linked to better outcomes. Their opposing functions make them critical in assessing and managing heart disease risk, guiding interventions such as lifestyle changes or medication to optimize cholesterol levels.  \n\nIn summary, **LDL-C and HDL-C** serve as key indicators in cardiovascular risk assessment, with **LDL-C** promoting harmful plaque formation and **HDL-C** offering protective benefits by aiding cholesterol clearance. Monitoring both markers allows for a balanced understanding of an individual's lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health.\",47\r\n1701,TC,LDL-C,\"**Summary of TC and LDL-C:**  \n\nTC (Total Cholesterol) and LDL-C (Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol) are both measures of cholesterol levels in the blood and are key lipid parameters used in cardiovascular risk assessment. TC represents the total amount of cholesterol present in the bloodstream, including LDL-C, HDL-C (High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol), and other lipid components. LDL-C, often referred to as \"\"bad cholesterol,\"\" is a specific subset of cholesterol that contributes to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.  \n\nBoth TC and LDL-C are routinely monitored in clinical settings to evaluate an individual's lipid profile and assess their risk for conditions such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke. Elevated levels of either parameter may indicate a higher risk of cardiovascular complications, though LDL-C is often prioritized in treatment guidelines due to its direct association with arterial plaque formation.
