It plays a key role in the breakdown of substances such as zolpidem, a medication used for treating insomnia, as well as R-warfarin, an anticoagulant. While the descriptions highlight different substrates (zolpidem in one and R-warfarin in the other), both confirm CYP1A2's function as a metabolic enzyme in drug processing. There is no direct contradiction between the two statements, as CYP1A2 is known to metabolize multiple compounds. The enzyme is significant in pharmacology due to its role in drug clearance and potential interactions with other medications. Further details on its specific substrates, regulatory mechanisms, or clinical implications could provide additional context, but the combined description establishes CYP1A2 as an important enzyme in drug metabolism.\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2762,唑吡坦,利福平,利福平能诱导CYP3A，加快唑吡坦代谢，降低其疗效,10\r\n2750,CYP1A2,唑吡坦,Zolpidem is metabolized by CYP1A2,6\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
