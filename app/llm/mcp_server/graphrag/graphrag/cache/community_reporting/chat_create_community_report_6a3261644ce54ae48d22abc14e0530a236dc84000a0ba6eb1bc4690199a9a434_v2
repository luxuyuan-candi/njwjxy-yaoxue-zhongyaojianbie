This pathological process is strongly linked to abnormal lipid metabolism, particularly elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Hyperlipidemia (high lipid levels) is a major risk factor, though other contributors include hypertension, smoking, diabetes, and imbalances in apolipoproteins (e.g., decreased apolipoprotein A or increased apolipoprotein B).  \n\nThe disease progresses as lipid deposits accumulate in the arterial intima, forming plaques that can restrict blood flow or rupture, causing acute complications such as coronary artery disease, angina, myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, or peripheral artery disease. Research highlights that atherosclerosis is both a cause and consequence of hyperlipidemia, with statin therapy being an effective treatment to stabilize plaques and manage lipid levels. Additionally, dietary interventions and lifestyle modifications can help prevent or slow its progression.  \n\nIn summary, atherosclerosis is a systemic vascular disorder with significant implications for cardiovascular health, driven by lipid dysregulation and influenced by multiple metabolic and lifestyle factors. Its complications underscore the importance of early detection and risk factor management.\",31\r\n1698,脑出血,\"**脑出血 (Intracerebral Hemorrhage, ICH)** 是一种严重的脑血管疾病，属于卒中（中风）的一种类型，具有较高的致死率和致残率。在不同地区，其发病率存在显著差异：在亚洲国家，脑出血占卒中病例的25%-55%，而在西方国家则占10%-15%。  \n\n脑出血的发病机制与多种因素相关，其中高血压和动脉粥样硬化是主要诱因。高血压可导致脑部血管壁压力增高，增加血管破裂风险；而动脉粥样硬化则可能引发血管壁结构异常，进一步加剧脑出血的发生。此外，研究还表明，脑出血的发病率与血清胆固醇水平存在一定关联，但具体机制仍需进一步探讨。  \n\n作为一种严重的脑血管事件，脑出血常导致突发性神经功能缺损，并可能引发长期残疾或死亡。因此，早期识别危险因素（如高血压、动脉粥样硬化等）并进行有效干预，对于降低脑出血的发病率和改善预后具有重要意义。\",4\r\n3432,低高密度脂蛋白血症,\"低高密度脂蛋白血症是冠心病的重要危险因素\"\"\",2\r\n3940,人工虫草,人工虫草是从青海采集新鲜虫草标本上分离下来的麦角菌科真菌冬虫夏草菌，经培养发酵后得到的菌丝体，能降低血脂，抑制动脉粥样硬化形成>,2\r\n3366,脑栓塞,\"脑栓塞是由动脉粥样硬化斑块脱落导致的脑血管阻塞事件。\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2909,高脂血症,心脑血管病,高脂血症与心脑血管病之间存在密切的关联。高脂血症主要通过促进动脉粥样硬化的形成，间接导致心脑血管病的发生和发展。动脉粥样硬化是心脑血管病的重要病理基础，而高脂血症则是其主要的危险因素之一。因此，控制高脂血症对于预防和治疗心脑血管病具有重要意义。,236\r\n3381,高脂血症,失明,高脂血症通过动脉粥样硬化间接导致失明,236\r\n3382,高脂血症,肾功能衰竭,高脂血症通过动脉粥样硬化间接导致肾功能衰竭,236\r\n4050,脑血栓,高脂血症,Hyperlipidemia contributes to conditions that may lead to cerebral thrombosis,236\r\n2856,动脉粥样硬化,冠心病,\"动脉粥样硬化是一种慢性血管疾病，其特征是动脉壁内脂质、胆固醇和其他物质的沉积，形成斑块，导致血管硬化和狭窄。作为冠心病的病理基础，动脉粥样硬化是冠心病发生和发展的重要诱因。冠心病是由于冠状动脉（心脏供血的主要血管）发生粥样硬化病变，导致血管狭窄或阻塞，进而引发心肌缺血、缺氧甚至坏死的一类心脏病。  \n\n研究表明，动脉粥样硬化可直接导致冠心病，因为冠状动脉的粥样硬化斑块会逐渐增大，影响血流，甚至可能破裂形成血栓，完全阻塞血管，引发心肌梗死。然而，并非所有动脉粥样硬化患者都会发展为冠心病，其进展受多种因素影响，如高血压、高血脂、糖尿病、吸烟和遗传倾向等。因此，动脉粥样硬化是冠心病的主要危险因素，但并非唯一决定因素。  \n\n综上，动脉粥样硬化与冠心病之间存在明确的因果关系，前者是后者的病理基础，而后者是前者的严重临床后果之一。有效控制动脉粥样硬化的进展，如通过健康饮食、规律运动、药物治疗等方式，可以显著降低冠心病的发病风险。\",82\r\n3031,动脉粥样硬化,脑出血,\"动脉粥样硬化是一种慢性血管疾病，其特征是动脉壁内脂质、胆固醇和其他物质的沉积形成斑块，导致血管狭窄和硬化。当这一病理过程发生在脑部血管时，称为脑部动脉粥样硬化。脑出血是指脑实质内或脑膜下的血管破裂导致的出血，是一种严重的脑血管事件。  \n\n研究表明，动脉粥样硬化与脑出血之间存在关联。动脉粥样硬化会使脑血管壁变得脆弱，失去原有的弹性和强度，从而增加血管破裂的风险。此外，动脉粥样硬化斑块可能引起局部血流动力学改变，进一步加剧血管损伤。因此，脑部动脉粥样硬化被认为是脑出血的一个重要危险因素。  \n\n综上所述，动脉粥样硬化，尤其是影响脑部血管的病变，可通过削弱血管结构和功能，显著提高脑出血的发生概率。这一关联强调了早期干预动脉粥样硬化的重要性，以降低脑出血等严重并发症的风险。\",35\r\n3186,低高密度脂蛋白血症,动脉粥样硬化,低高密度脂蛋白水平与动脉粥样硬化发展密切相关,33\r\n3996,人工虫草,动脉粥样硬化,人工虫草能抑制动脉粥样硬化形成,33\r\n3032,动脉粥样硬化,脑栓塞,动脉粥样硬化斑块脱落可导致脑栓塞。,32\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
