These medications work by blocking the action of angiotensin II, a hormone that constricts blood vessels, thereby helping to lower blood pressure and reduce strain on the heart.  \n\nARBs are known for their favorable pharmacokinetic profile, particularly their minimal interaction with the **CYP450 enzyme system**, which reduces the risk of metabolic drug-drug interactions. However, some ARBs may still exhibit **pharmacodynamic interactions**, meaning their effects could be influenced by other medications acting on the same physiological pathways. While most ARBs are not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, there is variability among individual drugs within the class regarding their metabolic pathways.  \n\nIn summary, ARBs are widely prescribed for hypertension and cardiovascular management due to their efficacy and generally low risk of metabolic interactions. Their mechanism of action, safety profile, and therapeutic applications make them a key option in antihypertensive treatment.\",13\r\n1186,ACEI,\"**Summary of ACEI (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors):**  \n\nACEI, or Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors, are a class of drugs primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and heart failure. They function by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which plays a key role in regulating blood pressure.  \n\nThese medications are rarely metabolized by CYP450 enzymes, meaning they have a low likelihood of pharmacokinetic drug interactions. However, they may exhibit pharmacodynamic interactions with other drugs, particularly those affecting blood pressure or kidney function. Despite this, clinical reports suggest that ACE inhibitors generally have minimal impact on lipid metabolism and no significant clinically relevant drug interactions.  \n\nACEIs are widely recognized as a first-line treatment for hypertension due to their efficacy and safety profile. Their therapeutic applications extend to heart failure management, where they help improve outcomes by reducing cardiac workload.  \n\nIn summary, ACE inhibitors are a well-established class of antihypertensive and cardioprotective drugs with a favorable metabolic profile and limited drug interaction risks, making them a reliable option for patients with cardiovascular conditions.\",11\r\n1185,CCB,\"**Summary of CCB (Calcium Channel Blocker):**  \n\nCCB, or Calcium Channel Blocker, is a class of drugs primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and other cardiovascular conditions. These medications work by inhibiting calcium ion influx into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac cells, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. CCBs are particularly effective in managing hypertension, including cases where patients have a history of myocardial infarction (heart attack).  \n\nWithin the CCB class, the dihydropyridine subclass is specifically noted for its efficacy in controlling hypertension. Additionally, CCBs are commonly prescribed as part of combination therapy for resistant hypertension, where other antihypertensive agents may not suffice.  \n\nBeyond their blood pressure-lowering effects, CCBs have minimal impact on lipid levels, making them a favorable option for patients with lipid metabolism concerns. Some CCBs also exhibit direct anti-atherosclerotic properties, contributing to their broader cardiovascular protective effects.  \n\nIn summary, CCBs are a versatile and widely used class of antihypertensive medications with applications in hypertension management, cardiovascular disease prevention, and combination therapy for treatment-resistant cases. Their favorable metabolic profile and additional anti-atherosclerotic benefits further enhance their clinical utility.\",10\r\n4926,厄贝沙坦 (IRBESARTAN),\"Irbesartan is an ARB drug with minimal CYP450 metabolism but potential pharmacodynamic interactions\"\"\",1\r\n4927,缬沙坦 (VALSARTAN),\"Valsartan is an ARB drug with minimal CYP450 metabolism but potential pharmacodynamic interactions\"\"\",1\r\n4928,氯沙坦 (LOSARTAN),\"Losartan is an ARB drug with minimal CYP450 metabolism but potential pharmacodynamic interactions\"\"\",1\r\n4929,替米沙坦 (TELMISARTAN),\"Telmisartan is an ARB drug with minimal CYP450 metabolism but potential pharmacodynamic interactions\"\"\",1\r\n4933,RASS SYSTEM,The RASS (Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System) is a hormone system that regulates blood pressure and fluid balance,1\r\n4949,POTASSIUM-SPARING DIURETICS,\"Drug class that can increase potassium levels when combined with ARBs\"\"\",1\r\n4953,ALISKIREN,,1\r\n4922,阿利吉仑 (ALISKIREN),\"Aliskiren is a drug that, when combined with ACE inhibitors or ARBs in diabetics, increases risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and renal impairment\"\"\",2\r\n4957,阿利吉仑,阿利吉仑是一种药物，与ACEI合用可能增加低血压和肾功能损伤风险,2\r\n1198,RAS BLOCKER,\"RAS blockers are a class of medications used in the treatment of hypertension, often combined with other drugs for resistant cases\"\"\",2\r\n4455,FELODIPINE,\"**FELODIPINE** is a calcium channel blocker (CCB) primarily used for the management of hypertension.

When co-administered with itraconazole, felodipine levels are drastically increased, leading to a heightened risk of hypotension due to excessive blood pressure reduction. This interaction underscores the importance of monitoring and potential dose adjustments when these drugs are used together.  \n\nIn summary, felodipine is an effective antihypertensive agent, but its therapeutic use requires caution in the presence of interacting medications like itraconazole to avoid adverse effects such as severe hypotension.\",2\r\n4921,沙库巴曲 (SACUBITRIL),\"Sacubitril is a drug that, when combined with ACE inhibitors, increases the risk of angioedema\"\"\",1\r\n4923,卡托普利 (CAPTOPRIL),\"Captopril is an ACE inhibitor drug with minimal CYP450 metabolism but potential pharmacodynamic interactions\"\"\",1\r\n4924,贝那普利 (BENAZEPRIL),\"Benazepril is an ACE inhibitor drug with minimal CYP450 metabolism but potential pharmacodynamic interactions\"\"\",1\r\n4925,福辛普利 (FOSINOPRIL),\"Fosinopril is an ACE inhibitor drug with minimal CYP450 metabolism but potential pharmacodynamic interactions\"\"\",1\r\n4956,沙库巴曲/缬沙坦,沙库巴曲/缬沙坦是一种药物，与ACEI合用增加血管神经性水肿风险,1\r\n2068,RENIN ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM INHIBITOR (RASI),\"A class of drugs used to treat hypertension by inhibiting the renin-angiotensin system, particularly long-acting formulations.\"\"\",1\r\n4457,AMILODIPINE,,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n989,ARB,高血压,ARB is one of the primary medications used to treat hypertension,60\r\n987,ACEI,ARB,\"**Summary of ACEI and ARB**  \n\nACE inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are two classes of drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions. Both are classified as antihypertensive medications and are widely used to manage high blood pressure. While their mechanisms differ—ACEI inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, whereas ARB block the binding of angiotensin II to its receptors—they share a common goal of reducing blood pressure and mitigating cardiovascular risks.  \n\nIn addition to their primary use in hypertension, both ACEI and ARB are prescribed for conditions such as heart failure, diabetic nephropathy, and post-myocardial infarction care, owing to their protective effects on the heart and kidneys. Notably, these drugs have minimal impact on lipid metabolism, making them suitable for patients with concurrent lipid disorders.  \n\nDespite their similarities, ACEI and ARB are not interchangeable in all clinical scenarios due to differences in side-effect profiles (e.g., ACEI may cause a dry cough, while ARB are less likely to do so). However, both remain cornerstone therapies in cardiovascular medicine, offering effective blood pressure control and organ protection. Their shared role in managing hypertension and related conditions underscores their importance in modern pharmacotherapy.\",24\r\n984,CCB,ACEI,\"**Summary of CCB and ACEI:**  \n\nCCB (Calcium Channel Blockers) and ACEI (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors) are two distinct classes of drugs primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure). Both are widely prescribed for managing cardiovascular conditions, though they function through different mechanisms.  \n\nCCBs work by inhibiting calcium entry into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac cells, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. ACEIs, on the other hand, block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor, thereby lowering blood pressure and reducing strain on the heart.  \n\nWhile both drug classes share a primary indication for hypertension, they may also be used for other cardiovascular conditions, such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or kidney protection in diabetic patients. The descriptions provided emphasize their role in hypertension treatment, with one noting their broader application in cardiovascular care. There are no contradictions in the given descriptions—rather, they complement each other by reinforcing the primary use of CCBs and ACEIs while acknowledging their wider therapeutic potential.  \n\nIn summary, CCB and ACEI are essential antihypertensive medications with additional benefits in managing various cardiovascular disorders.
