It encompasses various conditions, often linked to hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperlipidemia (elevated cholesterol levels), and other risk factors such as poor dietary habits. These disorders are frequently associated with complications arising from uncontrolled hypertension, emphasizing the need for proactive risk assessment and management.  \n\nThe disease is influenced by multiple factors, including lifestyle choices like diet, as well as physiological conditions such as high cholesterol and sustained high blood pressure. Its prevalence and severity underscore the importance of early detection, preventive measures, and long-term management strategies to mitigate its impact. Collectively, cardiovascular disease represents a significant public health challenge, requiring comprehensive approaches to address its underlying causes and associated complications.  \n\nIn summary, cardiovascular disease involves a spectrum of heart and blood vessel disorders, driven by hypertension, cholesterol imbalances, and modifiable risk factors. Effective prevention and management are critical to reducing its global burden.

It can affect individuals of any body weight and may exhibit seasonal variations in lipid levels. A major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, hyperlipidemia significantly increases the likelihood of coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis—the buildup of fatty deposits in arteries.  \n\nThis condition is often asymptomatic, earning it the label of a \"\"silent\"\" health issue, as it frequently goes undetected without routine screening. However, its long-term effects are substantial, contributing to the development of serious cardiovascular complications. Hyperlipidemia is also associated with other health conditions, such as hypertension, further amplifying the risk of heart disease and stroke.  \n\nGiven its widespread impact and role in cardiovascular morbidity, hyperlipidemia remains a critical public health concern requiring early detection and management to mitigate associated risks.\",12\r\n2301,SEASONAL CHANGES,,1\r\n3080,OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS,Nutrients found in fish and nuts that help lower triglyceride levels and reduce cardiovascular risk>,1\r\n3081,DIETARY FIBER,\"A component of foods like oats, barley, and fruits that helps lower cholesterol and improve metabolic health>\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1758,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE,HYPERLIPIDEMIA,Hyperlipidemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease,21\r\n1692,HYPERLIPIDEMIA,SEASONAL CHANGES,\"Hyperlipidemia levels fluctuate with seasons, with cholesterol highest in autumn and triglycerides highest in spring.\",13\r\n2457,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE,OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS,Omega-3 fatty acids help lower triglyceride levels and reduce cardiovascular risk,10\r\n2458,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE,DIETARY FIBER,\"Dietary fiber helps lower cholesterol, which reduces cardiovascular disease risk\",10\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
