This plaque accumulation, primarily composed of cholesterol, lipids, and other substances, restricts blood flow to the heart, potentially leading to myocardial ischemia, heart attacks, or other life-threatening complications.  \n\nThe disease is strongly linked to abnormal lipid metabolism, particularly elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), as well as reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL). High cholesterol (hyperlipidemia) is a major contributor, with LDL often referred to as a \"\"source\"\" of CHD. Additionally, factors such as diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, age, gender, family history, and unhealthy lifestyle habits significantly influence risk.  \n\nDietary choices play a crucial role in both prevention and management. Reducing saturated fats, avoiding trans fats, and increasing HDL through foods like cornmeal may lower risk. Alcohol consumption and lipid metabolism also interact in influencing CHD progression. Notably, the Inuit population exhibits a significantly lower incidence, possibly due to genetic or dietary factors.  \n\nCHD is exacerbated by conditions like hyperlipidemia and diabetes, which accelerate atherosclerosis. Conversely, lifestyle modifications—such as exercise, balanced nutrition, and smoking cessation—can mitigate risk. The condition is often detected through lipid profile abnormalities and may present with complications like angina, heart failure, or sudden cardiac death.  \n\nIn summary, CHD is a multifactorial disease rooted in arterial plaque buildup, driven by lipid imbalances and modifiable risk factors. Early intervention through lifestyle changes and medical management is critical to reducing its severe health consequences.\",52\r\n3431,MYOCARDIAL ISCHEMIA,\"Myocardial ischemia is a condition where blood flow to the heart is reduced, often caused by coronary artery disease\"\"\",1\r\n3448,FAMILY HISTORY OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE,Family history of early-onset coronary heart disease (before age 55 in males or 65 in females) is a significant non-modifiable risk factor,1\r\n3449,AGE,,1\r\n3450,GENDER,,1\r\n3746,CORNMEAL,\"Cornmeal is used in a recipe with japonica rice, 10 grams of cornmeal with 75 grams of japonica rice, cooked together, suitable for high cholesterol, coronary heart disease, and atherosclerosis patients\",1\r\n3998,SATURATED FATTY ACIDS,\"Saturated fatty acids are found in animal meats, dairy products, and animal fats, and are known to raise blood lipids and increase the risk of heart disease\"\"\",1\r\n4082,PRIMARY PREVENTION,\"Primary prevention involves lowering cholesterol in individuals with risk factors for coronary heart disease but no existing condition.\"\"\",1\r\n4083,SECONDARY PREVENTION,\"Secondary prevention involves lowering cholesterol in individuals already diagnosed with coronary heart disease to prevent further complications.\"\"\",1\r\n4084,CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT,\"A surgical procedure to improve blood flow to the heart in patients with severe coronary heart disease.\"\"\",1\r\n4085,CORONARY STENT PLACEMENT,\"A procedure to place a stent in narrowed coronary arteries to improve blood flow.\"\"\",1\r\n3469,LIPOPROTEIN(A),\"Lipoprotein(a) is an independent lipoprotein that can cause arteriosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and myocardial infarction when levels are elevated>\",3\r\n3410,MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,\"**Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack)**  \n\nMyocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, is a severe medical condition that occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked for an extended period, leading to damage or death of the heart muscle. This blockage is often caused by atherosclerosis, a buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which restricts blood supply. Myocardial infarction is a critical complication of coronary heart disease and is frequently associated with elevated lipid levels, including very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a), contributing to its development.  \n\nThe condition is strongly linked to high lipidemia (elevated blood lipids), and lipid-lowering therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction in individuals with coronary heart disease. Additionally, some alternative treatments, such as garlic juice, have been mentioned in relation to managing or mitigating the condition, though further research is needed to confirm efficacy.  \n\nIn summary, myocardial infarction is a life-threatening outcome of coronary artery disease, primarily driven by atherosclerosis and exacerbated by poor lipid profiles.

Atherosclerosis is the underlying mechanism that leads to the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. This narrowing, often due to the accumulation of fatty deposits, cholesterol, and other substances, restricts blood flow and oxygen delivery to the heart, resulting in coronary heart disease.  \n\nThe relationship between atherosclerosis and CHD is well-established, with atherosclerosis serving as the principal cause of CHD. The progression of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries directly contributes to the development of CHD by impairing arterial function and increasing the risk of complications such as angina, heart attacks, and other ischemic heart conditions. While other factors like hypertension, smoking, and diabetes may exacerbate CHD risk, atherosclerosis remains the central pathological process driving the disease.  \n\nIn summary, coronary heart disease is a consequence of atherosclerosis affecting the coronary arteries, with the latter being the primary cause of the former.
