It is often associated with elevated serum triglyceride levels and can lead to high lipid blood disease (hyperlipidemia), particularly due to poor dietary habits and physical inactivity. Obesity increases the likelihood of developing other serious health complications, including cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, and additional comorbidities. The condition arises from a combination of genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors, with sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy eating patterns being major contributors. While descriptions vary slightly in phrasing, they consistently emphasize obesity's role as a risk factor for metabolic disturbances and broader health issues. Management typically involves lifestyle modifications, such as improved nutrition and increased physical activity, alongside medical interventions when necessary.\",5\r\n2300,LOW HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINEMIA,\"A condition characterized by low levels of high-density lipoprotein, often associated with obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, and certain diseases like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and liver cirrhosis.\"\"\",3\r\n2244,SMOKING,\"**SMOKING** is a significant behavioral risk factor linked to various cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. It is strongly associated with an increased risk of **high lipid blood disease**, **atherosclerosis**, and **coronary heart disease**, primarily due to its adverse effects on lipid metabolism. Smoking elevates **triglyceride levels** while negatively impacting **serum HDL (good cholesterol) levels**, further contributing to cardiovascular complications.  \n\nResearch indicates that smoking is a **major reversible risk factor** for **coronary atherosclerosis**, with studies demonstrating that quitting smoking can substantially reduce cardiovascular risks, eventually bringing them down to levels comparable to those of non-smokers. Notably, **HDL levels** can recover to normal within a year of cessation.  \n\nAdditionally, smoking is widely recognized as an activity to **avoid** for effective **blood pressure and cholesterol management**, as it exacerbates conditions that lead to heart disease. Public health recommendations consistently emphasize smoking cessation as a critical step in reducing the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.  \n\nIn summary, smoking poses a well-documented threat to cardiovascular health through its influence on lipid profiles and atherosclerosis development, but its effects are reversible upon quitting, reinforcing the importance of cessation for long-term health benefits.\",6\r\n2404,ALCOHOL,\"**ALCOHOL**  \n\nAlcohol has notable effects on lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health. It can inhibit lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down fats in the bloodstream, thereby promoting the synthesis of endogenous cholesterol and triglycerides. This mechanism contributes to elevated blood lipid levels, which may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications. Due to these metabolic impacts, alcohol is often recommended to be consumed in moderation or limited in dietary guidelines. Health advisories frequently emphasize restricting alcohol intake to mitigate its potential adverse effects on lipid profiles and overall health.  \n\nIn summary, while alcohol consumption may influence lipid metabolism by raising cholesterol and triglyceride levels, dietary recommendations consistently advise limiting its intake to support better metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes.\",2\r\n2261,PASSIVE SMOKING,\"Passive smoking is noted to decrease serum HDL levels and increase cholesterol levels, emphasizing the importance of quitting smoking for both personal and public health.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1588,HIGH LIPID BLOOD DISEASE,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,High lipid blood disease is a risk factor for coronary heart disease,36\r\n1515,TRIGLYCERIDES,OBESITY,Elevated serum triglyceride levels are associated with obesity,22\r\n1688,LOW HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINEMIA,OBESITY,Low high-density lipoproteinemia is commonly seen in obese individuals.,8\r\n1838,SMOKING,ALCOHOL,Both smoking and alcohol are mentioned as things to avoid or limit,8\r\n1610,SMOKING,PASSIVE SMOKING,\"Both smoking and passive smoking negatively affect serum HDL and cholesterol levels, with quitting smoking benefiting both the individual and those around them.\",7\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
