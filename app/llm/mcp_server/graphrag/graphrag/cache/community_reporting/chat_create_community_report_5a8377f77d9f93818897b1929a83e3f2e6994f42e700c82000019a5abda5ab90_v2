They are also effective in treating coronary syndromes and heart failure, making them versatile in cardiovascular care. Among the various types, selective β1 blockers are often preferred for elderly patients due to their targeted action. Additionally, beta-blockers are considered a first-line treatment for hypertensive patients with elevated heart rates, as they help regulate both blood pressure and heart rate.  \n\nThis summary integrates all provided descriptions, highlighting the key therapeutic uses and considerations for beta-blockers without contradictions.\",9\n899,HFPEF,\"**HFpEF (Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction)** is a chronic heart failure condition characterized by the heart's impaired ability to relax and fill with blood properly, despite maintaining a preserved ejection fraction. This condition often arises due to underlying hypertension and requires distinct management approaches compared to other forms of heart failure. Treatment recommendations may include the use of **ARBs (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers)** to address the condition. HFpEF represents a significant clinical challenge due to its complex pathophysiology and the need for tailored therapeutic strategies.\",8\n964,TIA,\"**TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack)** is a temporary cerebrovascular event characterized by symptoms similar to those of a stroke, though it does not cause permanent damage. It is often caused by factors such as hypertension and results from a temporary disruption of blood flow to the brain. While the effects of a TIA are short-lived, the condition significantly increases the risk of a future stroke, making it a critical warning sign that requires medical attention.\",4\n894,LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY,LVH is part of an important event chain leading from hypertension to heart failure,3\n1546,Β RECEPTOR BLOCKERS,Beta receptor blockers are antihypertensive drugs that improve long-term prognosis in patients with myocardial infarction and are recommended for use in hypertension with coronary artery disease>,2\n1095,ACEI,\"**ACEI (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor)** is a class of antihypertensive drugs that inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thereby relaxing blood vessels and lowering blood pressure. ACEIs are widely used to treat **hypertension** and are particularly recommended for patients with comorbid conditions such as **diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), proteinuria, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), chronic heart failure (HFrEF), chronic coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and peripheral artery disease (PAD)**. They improve prognosis in **heart failure patients** by reducing hospitalization rates and mortality and may also enhance walking distance in **PAD patients with hypertension**.  \n\nACEIs are considered **first-line therapy** for hypertension in **diabetic patients**, as they help protect target organs without worsening metabolic conditions. They are also recommended for **systemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma renal crisis**. However, they should **not be combined with ARBs (Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers) or direct renin inhibitors** due to increased risks of **kidney events and hyperkalemia**. Additionally, ACEIs are **contraindicated in pregnancy** due to potential fetal risks and should be **discontinued one day before surgery** to avoid **intraoperative hypotension**.  \n\nWhen transitioning from ACEIs to **ARNIs (Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitors)**, a washout period of **at least 36 hours** is required. Some studies suggest ACEIs may also be associated with a **reduced risk of mood disorders**. Common examples of ACEIs include **captopril and fosinopril**, which are also used in pediatric hypertension management.  \n\nIn summary, ACEIs are a versatile class of **RAS inhibitors** with broad applications in cardiovascular and renal diseases, serving as a foundational therapy in **combined antihypertensive regimens**, especially for high-risk patients.\",53\n934,SPRINT,\"The **Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)** is a clinical trial conducted in the U.S. that investigated the effects of intensive versus standard blood pressure lowering strategies in hypertensive patients. The study specifically examined outcomes such as cardiovascular events, including heart failure incidence, and provided evidence supporting the benefits of intensive blood pressure management. SPRINT also focused on isolated systolic hypertension treatment and included a subgroup analysis of elderly hypertensive patients aged 75 and above, demonstrating consistent cardiovascular benefits from intensive降压治疗 (blood pressure-lowering therapy) regardless of frailty status. The trial serves as a key reference for evaluating blood pressure management strategies in diverse patient populations.\",13\n1094,CCB,\"**Calcium Channel Blockers (CCB)** are a class of antihypertensive drugs widely used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure) and related cardiovascular conditions. They function by blocking calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure. CCBs are often prescribed in combination with other medications, such as angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA), or ACE inhibitors (ACEI), particularly when monotherapy is insufficient for blood pressure control.  \n\nCCBs are further categorized into **dihydropyridine** (recommended for hypertension) and **non-dihydropyridine** (not typically recommended for hypertension) subtypes. They are particularly effective in specific patient populations, including those with:  \n- **Diabetes** (as part of combination therapy),  \n- **Chronic kidney disease (CKD)** (for kidney protection),  \n- **Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)** and **lower extremity arterial disease**,  \n- **Stable coronary artery disease** (reducing myocardial oxygen consumption and angina attacks),  \n- **Systemic sclerosis** (as adjunct therapy when ACEI alone is inadequate),  \n- **Polycythemia vera (PV)** patients with hypertension.  \n\nAdditionally, CCBs have been associated with a reduced risk of dementia and are commonly used in **East Asia** due to their efficacy. They also enhance the effects of anesthetic and analgesic medications during surgery.  \n\nHowever, CCBs may cause side effects such as **ankle edema** and, when combined with antidepressants like SSRIs, may lead to **orthostatic hypotension**. Long-acting formulations are preferred in hypertension management.  \n\nIn summary, CCBs are versatile antihypertensive agents with broad applications in cardiovascular and renal protection, often used in combination therapies for optimal blood pressure control.\",51\n1096,ARB,\"**ARB (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers)** are a class of antihypertensive medications that block the AT1 receptor, inhibiting the effects of angiotensin II to relax blood vessels and lower blood pressure. They are widely used to treat **hypertension (high blood pressure)**, **heart failure (particularly HFrEF, where they improve prognosis and reduce hospitalization and mortality rates)**, and **diabetic nephropathy**, while also providing **organ protection in diabetic patients**.  \n\nARBs are recommended as **first-line therapy** for various patient groups, including those with **peripheral arterial disease (PAD)**, **lower extremity arterial disease**, **obesity**, **chronic kidney disease (CKD) with proteinuria**, and **autoimmune conditions** where ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) are not tolerated. They are also suggested as an **alternative to ACEIs** for patients experiencing side effects like **dry cough**.  \n\nAdditionally, ARBs may offer **benefits beyond blood pressure control**, such as **reducing the risk of mood disorders**, **improving hyperuricemia**, and serving as a **base for combined antihypertensive therapy in diabetic patients with hypertension**. However, they **should not be combined with ACEIs or direct renin inhibitors** due to potential adverse effects like **hyperkalemia and kidney events**.  \n\nPrecautions include **discontinuing ARBs before surgery** to avoid **hypotension (low blood pressure)** and **avoiding use in pregnancy** due to potential risks. Common ARBs include **losartan**, which is also used in pediatric hypertension management.  \n\nIn summary, ARBs are a versatile class of **RAS inhibitors** with broad applications in **cardiovascular and renal protection**, particularly in high-risk populations such as those with **diabetes, obesity, or heart failure**.\",48\n1154,DIURETICS,,7\n1559,PAD,\"Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) is a condition affecting the peripheral arteries, with a prevalence of 3%-10% in the general population and 15%-20% in individuals over 70 years old.
