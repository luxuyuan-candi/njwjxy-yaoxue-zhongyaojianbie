It affects how the body processes food into energy and is associated with a range of serious health complications, particularly cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis. Diabetes often coexists with other metabolic abnormalities, including **hypertension**, **high cholesterol (dyslipidemia)**, and **elevated triglyceride levels**, which collectively increase the risk of **cardiovascular events (ASCVD)**.  \n\nThe condition is frequently linked to **hyperlipidemia**, with type 2 diabetes patients often exhibiting obesity and lipid metabolism disorders. Diabetes can both contribute to and be exacerbated by high lipid levels, creating a cyclical relationship that complicates treatment. It is also a significant **comorbidity** in hypertensive patients, further elevating cardiovascular risk.  \n\nManagement of diabetes requires a multifaceted approach, including **blood pressure control**, **LDL level management**, **dietary adjustments**, **exercise**, and **medication**. The disease is particularly prevalent in elderly populations, often necessitating complex treatment regimens due to its association with multiple metabolic disturbances.  \n\nDiabetes is sometimes referred to as a **\"\"sweet killer\"\"** due to its role in increasing cardiovascular disease incidence. Both **type 1 and type 2 diabetes** significantly raise the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease, with diabetic patients facing a higher overall risk of vascular complications.  \n\nIn summary, diabetes is a **chronic, metabolic disorder** with far-reaching effects on cardiovascular health, frequently intertwined with **hypertension**, **dyslipidemia**, and **obesity**, necessitating comprehensive and proactive management to mitigate its severe complications.\",31\r\n1108,HYPERTENSION,,80\r\n1112,KIDNEYS,\"The kidneys play a critical role in sodium excretion and blood pressure regulation, with dysfunction leading to hypertension\"\"\",5\r\n1342,HONEST,\"The **HONEST** study is a large-scale prospective, real-world observational study focused on investigating the relationship between home blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular outcomes in patients undergoing antihypertensive therapy. Designed as a comprehensive research initiative, it aims to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of home-based blood pressure measurements in predicting and managing cardiovascular events.  \n\nBy leveraging real-world data, the study evaluates long-term trends and outcomes, offering a practical perspective on antihypertensive treatment outside controlled clinical settings. The dual descriptions emphasize its observational, non-interventional nature, highlighting its role in bridging gaps between clinical trials and everyday patient care.  \n\nIn summary, **HONEST** serves as a critical resource for understanding the implications of home blood pressure monitoring in cardiovascular risk assessment, reinforcing its importance in hypertension management. The study’s prospective design ensures robust, longitudinal data collection, contributing to evidence-based guidelines for patient care.\",5\r\n3188,CHOLESTEROL,\"**Cholesterol** is a lipid that plays a critical role in human physiology but also exhibits seasonal variation, with studies indicating its highest levels in autumn and lowest in summer. It is found in various animal-based foods, with notable examples including duck eggs, chicken eggs, and pig brain, which are often discussed in the context of dietary cholesterol content.  \n\nCholesterol is commonly categorized into \"\"good\"\" (HDL, or high-density lipoprotein) and \"\"bad\"\" (LDL, or low-density lipoprotein) types, each influencing cardiovascular health differently. Optimal levels of these lipoproteins are essential for maintaining health, as imbalances—particularly elevated LDL—can contribute to atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of plaque in arteries. Discussions on cholesterol often emphasize the importance of monitoring and managing these levels to reduce cardiovascular risks.  \n\nIn summary, cholesterol is a biologically significant lipid with seasonal fluctuations, dietary sources in animal products, and a well-documented impact on health through its HDL and LDL subtypes. Understanding its dynamics is key to both nutritional and clinical perspectives.\",46\r\n3190,TRIGLYCERIDES,,39\r\n3186,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,\"**Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)** is a serious cardiovascular condition characterized by the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries due to atherosclerosis, a process driven by the buildup of arterial plaque. This plaque accumulation, primarily composed of cholesterol, lipids, and other substances, restricts blood flow to the heart, potentially leading to myocardial ischemia, heart attacks, or other life-threatening complications.  \n\nThe disease is strongly linked to abnormal lipid metabolism, particularly elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), as well as reduced high-density lipoprotein (HDL). High cholesterol (hyperlipidemia) is a major contributor, with LDL often referred to as a \"\"source\"\" of CHD. Additionally, factors such as diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity, age, gender, family history, and unhealthy lifestyle habits significantly influence risk.  \n\nDietary choices play a crucial role in both prevention and management. Reducing saturated fats, avoiding trans fats, and increasing HDL through foods like cornmeal may lower risk. Alcohol consumption and lipid metabolism also interact in influencing CHD progression. Notably, the Inuit population exhibits a significantly lower incidence, possibly due to genetic or dietary factors.  \n\nCHD is exacerbated by conditions like hyperlipidemia and diabetes, which accelerate atherosclerosis. Conversely, lifestyle modifications—such as exercise, balanced nutrition, and smoking cessation—can mitigate risk. The condition is often detected through lipid profile abnormalities and may present with complications like angina, heart failure, or sudden cardiac death.  \n\nIn summary, CHD is a multifactorial disease rooted in arterial plaque buildup, driven by lipid imbalances and modifiable risk factors. Early intervention through lifestyle changes and medical management is critical to reducing its severe health consequences.\",52\r\n3187,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,\"**Atherosclerosis** is a chronic cardiovascular disease characterized by the progressive buildup of fatty deposits, cholesterol, and plaques within the arterial walls. This accumulation leads to the hardening and narrowing of arteries, reducing blood flow and increasing the risk of serious complications such as coronary heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes. The condition is primarily driven by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and other lipids in the blood, a state known as hyperlipidemia. However, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or \"\"good\"\" cholesterol, may help mitigate its progression.  \n\nThe disease develops when lipids, including cholesterol, accumulate in the artery walls, forming plaques that can restrict blood flow or rupture, triggering clot formation. Over time, these changes contribute to arterial stiffness and blockages, impairing oxygen and nutrient delivery to vital organs. Risk factors include high cholesterol, particularly elevated LDL levels, as well as other metabolic and lifestyle influences.  \n\nWhile the descriptions vary slightly in phrasing, they consistently emphasize atherosclerosis as a lipid-driven process that results in arterial plaque buildup, vascular narrowing, and heightened cardiovascular risk. The condition is both preventable and manageable through lifestyle modifications, lipid-lowering therapies, and monitoring of cholesterol levels.\",33\r\n1103,CHRONIC MENTAL STRESS,\"Long-term mental stress is identified as a contributing factor to hypertension\"\"\",4\r\n3471,HIGH BLOOD LIPIDS,\"High blood lipids is a condition that can lead to hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke, often caused by lifestyle and dietary habits\"\"\",4\r\n1235,BLOOD PRESSURE,,3\r\n1155,TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK (TIA),\"A temporary stroke-like condition related to hypertension\"\"\",2\r\n1157,KIDNEY DISEASE,\"**Kidney Disease** is a medical condition that can arise as a complication of severe hypertension, as prolonged high blood pressure can damage the kidneys over time. The kidneys play a critical role in filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood, and hypertension can impair their function by damaging blood vessels and reducing their efficiency. Additionally, kidney disease itself may contribute to metabolic disturbances, such as elevated lipid levels (high lipidemia), further complicating the patient's health. Thus, kidney disease and hypertension often have a bidirectional relationship, where each condition can exacerbate the other. Proper management of blood pressure and lipid levels is essential to mitigate the progression of kidney disease and its associated complications.  \n\n*(Word count: 100)*\",2\r\n1164,PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE,\"A circulatory condition causing narrowed blood vessels, listed as a clinical complication of hypertension\"\"\",2\r\n4459,ACE INHIBITORS,\"**ACE Inhibitors** are a class of drugs primarily used to treat hypertension by relaxing blood vessels, as denoted by the letter \"\"A\"\" in treatment protocols. They function by inhibiting the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which helps lower blood pressure. However, their use may carry an increased risk of angioedema (a rapid swelling beneath the skin) when combined with DPP-4 inhibitors, another class of medications. While effective for managing high blood pressure, healthcare providers should be cautious about potential adverse interactions, particularly with DPP-4 inhibitors, to mitigate the risk of angioedema. This dual role—as a key antihypertensive therapy with a noted interaction risk—highlights the importance of careful medication management when prescribing ACE inhibitors.\",2\r\n1107,LIPID ABNORMALITIES,\"Metabolic disorder identified as a contributing factor to hypertension risk\"\"\",1\r\n1154,PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA,\"A tumor condition examined using MRI in hypertensive patients\"\"\",1\r\n1158,PRIMARY ALDOSTERONISM,,1\r\n1156,LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY,\"A cardiac complication of hypertension\"\"\",1\r\n1162,CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE,\"A category of diseases affecting blood vessels and blood supply to the brain, listed as a clinical complication of hypertension\"\"\",1\r\n1163,CARDIAC DISEASE,\"A category of heart conditions including myocardial infarction and heart failure, listed as clinical complications of hypertension\"\"\",1\r\n1227,SULFATE MAGNESIUM,\"A medication used for treating severe preeclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension, administered via deep intramuscular injection every 4 hours with a total daily dose of 25~30 g/d\"\"\",1\r\n1228,FOLLOW-UP PLAN,\"A structured plan for monitoring and managing hypertension, including risk factor intervention, treatment adjustments, and regular check-ups\"\"\",1\r\n1231,BLOOD TESTS,\"Laboratory tests including blood potassium, glucose, and lipid profile used to monitor hypertension complications\"\"\",1\r\n1232,URINE TESTS,\"Urinalysis performed to assess kidney function in hypertensive patients\"\"\",1\r\n1383,LEENEN FH,Researcher in antihypertensive treatment trials>,1\r\n4073,FIBRIC ACID DERIVATIVES,\"Fibric acid derivatives are a class of lipid-lowering drugs that may cause myopathy in some patients with renal failure\"\"\",1\r\n4074,POLYENOIC ACID,\"Polyenoic acid is a lipid-lowering drug that does not have significant interactions with antihypertensive drugs\"\"\",1\r\n4075,FISH OIL LIPID-LOWERING PILLS,\"Fish oil lipid-lowering pills are a class of lipid-lowering drugs that do not have significant interactions with antihypertensive drugs\"\"\",1\r\n4432,HEART FAILURE,\"Heart failure is a condition where the heart is unable to pump sufficiently, which can be related to hypertension\",1\r\n4433,ATRIAL FIBRILLATION,\"Atrial fibrillation is an irregular and often rapid heart rate that can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other complications, sometimes associated with hypertension\",1\r\n4434,SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE,\"Systolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats\"\"\",1\r\n4435,DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE,\"Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats\"\"\",1\r\n4436,LIFESTYLE FACTORS,\"Lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, and smoking can influence hypertension risk\"\"\",1\r\n4437,PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS,\"Psychosocial factors including stress and work environment may contribute to hypertension\"\"\",1\r\n4438,LABORATORY TESTS,\"Laboratory tests are used to assess hypertension and related cardiovascular risks\"\"\",1\r\n4451,TARGET ORGAN DAMAGE,\"Organ damage caused by long-term hypertension including heart, kidney, brain and vascular systems\"\"\",1\r\n4452,ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS,\"Medications used to treat hypertension including long-acting and combination formulations\"\"\",1\r\n4453,SPIRONOLACTONE,\"Diuretic used in specific cases of hypertension, particularly when estimated glomerular filtration rate is below 30ml·min-1·(1.73m2)-1\",1\r\n4454,LOOP DIURETIC,Diuretic used when estimated glomerular filtration rate is below 30ml·min-1·(1.73m2)-1,1\r\n4456,NSAIDS,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that can antagonize antihypertensive effects,1\r\n4458,CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS,Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are a class of medications used to treat hypertension by relaxing blood vessels and reducing heart rate.

This condition arises when elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), lipoprotein(a), and serum triglycerides contribute to lipid deposition in arterial walls, leading to reduced blood flow and potential blockages. Key factors influencing its development include high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia), untreated long-term hypercholesterolemia, and excessive alcohol intake.  \n\nThe disease is often associated with elevated lipid profile results, particularly high LDL and triglyceride levels, which accelerate plaque formation. Over time, arteriosclerosis can progress to severe complications, such as arterial stiffness and impaired circulation, increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Treatment typically involves statin-based lipid-lowering drugs to manage cholesterol levels and slow disease progression.  \n\nWhile some descriptions emphasize cholesterol as the primary contributor, others highlight the role of triglycerides or alcohol consumption. However, these factors collectively contribute to arterial damage, with cholesterol being the most consistently cited cause. The condition underscores the importance of early lipid management to prevent irreversible arterial hardening.  \n\nIn summary, arteriosclerosis is a multifactorial disease driven by lipid imbalances, leading to arterial plaque buildup, reduced vessel elasticity, and heightened cardiovascular risk. Proactive monitoring of lipid levels and lifestyle modifications are critical in mitigating its progression.\",15\r\n2136,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,,13\r\n2396,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,\"**High Lipidemia** is a medical condition characterized by elevated levels of lipids—including cholesterol and triglycerides—in the blood. It is often caused by dietary and lifestyle factors such as excessive alcohol consumption, high-fat diets, lack of exercise, and genetic predisposition. Poor management of these factors can lead to serious health complications, including pancreatitis, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and metabolic disorders. High lipidemia is also a significant global health concern, acting as a \"\"silent killer\"\" and a major contributor to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.  \n\nThe condition is typically managed through dietary adjustments, regular exercise, and medication. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), high lipidemia is classified under categories such as \"\"blood stasis,\"\" \"\"phlegm-dampness,\"\" and \"\"lipid turbidity.\"\" TCM views it as a deficiency-excess syndrome, where phlegm and stasis are the manifestations, while deficiency serves as the root cause.  \n\nGiven its association with multiple systemic health risks, early detection and intervention are crucial to prevent long-term complications. Lifestyle modifications, alongside medical treatment, play a key role in controlling lipid levels and reducing the risk of associated diseases.\",53\r\n3327,HIGH LIPID BLOOD DISEASE,\"High lipid blood disease is a condition characterized by elevated levels of lipids in the blood, which can lead to various health issues such as dizziness, headache, insomnia, and memory decline>\",10\r\n3441,PRAVASTATIN,A medication used to lower cholesterol and treat hyperlipidemia>,8\r\n3356,HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"**High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)** is a type of cholesterol commonly referred to as \"\"good cholesterol\"\" due to its protective effects on cardiovascular health. It functions by removing excess cholesterol, particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL), from blood vessels and tissues, thereby helping to prevent arterial hardening and atherosclerosis. HDL is often termed the \"\"anti-atherosclerotic lipoprotein\"\" for its role in clearing cholesterol from arterial walls, reducing the risk of heart disease.  \n\nSeveral factors influence HDL levels. Regular exercise and physical activity are known to elevate HDL, while smoking has a negative impact, lowering levels by approximately 0.13–0.23 mmol/L compared to non-smokers. Dietary choices, such as consuming garlic, and lifestyle changes, including weight loss and smoking cessation, can also increase HDL concentrations.  \n\nBeyond cardiovascular benefits, HDL plays a role in broader health contexts, including stroke and hypertension in animals, where reduced levels are associated with adverse outcomes. Overall, HDL is a crucial component of lipid metabolism, promoting heart health by facilitating cholesterol removal from the bloodstream and counteracting the harmful effects of LDL. Maintaining optimal HDL levels through healthy lifestyle choices is widely recommended for long-term cardiovascular protection.\",19\r\n3500,HIGH BLOOD LIPID DISEASE,\"High blood lipid disease is a condition characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides, and reduced high-density lipoprotein, leading to coronary heart disease and hypertension\",5\r\n3208,LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"**Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)** is a type of lipoprotein responsible for transporting cholesterol into surrounding tissues, including blood vessels. It accounts for approximately 75% of total cholesterol in the body. LDL plays a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of arterial plaques. When LDL levels are elevated, it deposits cholesterol in the walls of arteries, contributing to plaque formation and narrowing of the blood vessels. This process increases the risk of coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular complications. Due to its role in cholesterol transport and plaque accumulation, LDL is often referred to as \"\"bad cholesterol.\"\" Elevated LDL levels are strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, making it a critical biomarker in cardiovascular health assessments.\",10\r\n3209,HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"**High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)**, commonly referred to as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol, is a vital component of lipid metabolism with significant benefits for cardiovascular health. HDL accounts for approximately 25% of total cholesterol in the body and plays a crucial role in transporting excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver for processing and excretion, a process known as reverse cholesterol transport. This mechanism helps prevent the buildup of cholesterol in arterial walls, thereby reducing the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.  \n\nHDL is widely recognized for its protective effects on the cardiovascular system. Low levels of HDL are associated with a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, while elevated levels are linked to improved heart health. HDL also activates key enzymes involved in lipoprotein metabolism, further aiding in cholesterol clearance.  \n\nThe measurement of HDL levels is typically expressed in millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Lifestyle factors, such as regular exercise, can increase HDL concentrations, enhancing its cardioprotective benefits. Due to its role in reducing cardiovascular risk, maintaining healthy HDL levels is an important aspect of preventive healthcare.  \n\nIn summary, High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is a beneficial form of cholesterol that supports cardiovascular health by facilitating cholesterol removal, preventing arterial plaque formation, and lowering the risk of heart disease. Its levels can be improved through physical activity, underscoring the importance of lifestyle in maintaining optimal HDL function.\",10\r\n2708,VEGETABLE OIL,Vegetable oil is a type of ingredient used in the meal plan,3\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n901,DIABETES,HYPERTENSION,\"**Summary of Diabetes and Hypertension:**  \n\nDiabetes mellitus (diabetes) and hypertension are closely interrelated conditions that significantly impact cardiovascular health. Diabetes exacerbates hypertension through metabolic mechanisms, such as insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, which contribute to elevated blood pressure.  \n\nWhile both conditions are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), their coexistence multiplicatively increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This synergistic effect underscores the importance of managing both conditions concurrently to mitigate their compounded impact on heart health.  \n\nIn summary, diabetes and hypertension interact through metabolic pathways, worsening each other’s effects, and their co-occurrence substantially heightens the risk of cardiovascular complications. Effective management requires addressing both conditions to reduce overall disease burden.\",111\r\n910,KIDNEYS,HYPERTENSION,Impaired renal sodium excretion is a key contributor to hypertension,85\r\n1131,HONEST,HYPERTENSION,\"The **HONEST** study, focused on **hypertension**, had its results published in the *Hypertension* journal.

Both are key components measured in lipid profiles, which assess metabolic health. Cholesterol is vital for cell membrane structure, hormone production, and bile acid synthesis, while triglycerides primarily serve as energy storage molecules. Together, they are involved in metabolic processes, including energy utilization and lipid transport. Although structurally and functionally distinct, both lipids contribute to overall lipid homeostasis and are important indicators of cardiovascular and metabolic health when monitored in clinical settings. Their balance is crucial for maintaining proper bodily functions, and imbalances may lead to health complications such as cardiovascular disease or metabolic disorders.\",85\r\n2842,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,\"**Summary of CORONARY HEART DISEASE and ATHEROSCLEROSIS:**  \n\nCoronary heart disease (CHD) is a cardiovascular condition primarily caused by atherosclerosis, a progressive disease characterized by the buildup of plaque in the arterial walls. Atherosclerosis is the underlying mechanism that leads to the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. This narrowing, often due to the accumulation of fatty deposits, cholesterol, and other substances, restricts blood flow and oxygen delivery to the heart, resulting in coronary heart disease.  \n\nThe relationship between atherosclerosis and CHD is well-established, with atherosclerosis serving as the principal cause of CHD. The progression of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries directly contributes to the development of CHD by impairing arterial function and increasing the risk of complications such as angina, heart attacks, and other ischemic heart conditions. While other factors like hypertension, smoking, and diabetes may exacerbate CHD risk, atherosclerosis remains the central pathological process driving the disease.  \n\nIn summary, coronary heart disease is a consequence of atherosclerosis affecting the coronary arteries, with the latter being the primary cause of the former. The descriptions consistently emphasize this causal link, underscoring the critical role of atherosclerosis in the pathogenesis of CHD.\",85\r\n899,CHRONIC MENTAL STRESS,HYPERTENSION,Prolonged stress activates physiological pathways that raise blood pressure,84\r\n3274,HIGH BLOOD LIPIDS,HYPERTENSION,\"High blood lipids can lead to hypertension\nElevated blood lipids can contribute to the development of hypertension\",84\r\n1037,HYPERTENSION,BLOOD PRESSURE,\"**Summary of Hypertension and Blood Pressure**  \n\nHypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a medical condition characterized by abnormally elevated blood pressure levels. Blood pressure measurement serves as the primary diagnostic and monitoring tool for hypertension, allowing healthcare providers to assess and manage the condition effectively. The relationship between hypertension and blood pressure is intrinsic, as hypertension is defined by sustained deviations from normal blood pressure ranges.  \n\nTogether, these descriptions highlight that hypertension is identified and tracked through blood pressure readings, emphasizing the critical role of blood pressure assessment in both diagnosis and ongoing management of the condition. The consistent theme is that abnormal blood pressure levels are the defining feature of hypertension, reinforcing the interdependence of these two concepts in clinical practice.  \n\n(Word count: 118)\",83\r\n953,HYPERTENSION,TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC ATTACK (TIA),Hypertension increases risk of TIA,82\r\n956,HYPERTENSION,KIDNEY DISEASE,\"Hypertension, or high blood pressure, and kidney disease are closely interrelated conditions. Prolonged or severe hypertension can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys, impairing their ability to function properly. Over time, this damage may progress to chronic kidney disease, as the kidneys struggle to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood effectively. The relationship between the two conditions is bidirectional, as kidney disease can also exacerbate hypertension by disrupting the body's regulation of blood pressure. Thus, uncontrolled hypertension is a significant risk factor for the development and progression of kidney disease, emphasizing the importance of early detection and management of high blood pressure to preserve kidney health.\",82\r\n963,HYPERTENSION,PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE,Hypertension contributes to development of peripheral vascular disease,82\r\n4597,HYPERTENSION,ACE INHIBITORS,ACE inhibitors are used in the treatment of hypertension as part of the medication regimen,82\r\n902,LIPID ABNORMALITIES,HYPERTENSION,Dyslipidemia contributes to vascular dysfunction in hypertension,81\r\n950,PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA,HYPERTENSION,Pheochromocytoma is a secondary cause of hypertension,81\r\n951,HYPERTENSION,PRIMARY ALDOSTERONISM,Primary aldosteronism is a secondary cause of hypertension,81\r\n954,HYPERTENSION,LEFT VENTRICULAR HYPERTROPHY,Hypertension can cause left ventricular hypertrophy,81\r\n961,HYPERTENSION,CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE,Hypertension is a major risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases like stroke,81\r\n962,HYPERTENSION,CARDIAC DISEASE,Hypertension significantly increases risk of various cardiac diseases,81\r\n1034,SULFATE MAGNESIUM,HYPERTENSION,Sulfate Magnesium is used to treat severe cases of hypertension such as preeclampsia,81\r\n1035,HYPERTENSION,FOLLOW-UP PLAN,Hypertension management requires a detailed follow-up plan to monitor and adjust treatment,81\r\n1039,HYPERTENSION,BLOOD TESTS,Blood tests help monitor metabolic complications of hypertension,81\r\n1040,HYPERTENSION,URINE TESTS,Urine tests assess kidney damage from long-term hypertension,81\r\n1156,HYPERTENSION,LEENEN FH,Leenen's research was published in Hypertension journal,81\r\n4109,HYPERTENSION,FIBRIC ACID DERIVATIVES,\"Fibric acid derivatives may cause myopathy in some patients with renal failure, requiring careful dosing and monitoring\",81\r\n4112,HYPERTENSION,POLYENOIC ACID,Polyenoic acid does not have significant interactions with antihypertensive drugs and can be used in patients with both high cholesterol and hypertension,81\r\n4113,HYPERTENSION,FISH OIL LIPID-LOWERING PILLS,Fish oil lipid-lowering pills do not have significant interactions with antihypertensive drugs and can be used in patients with both high cholesterol and hypertension,81\r\n4552,HYPERTENSION,HEART FAILURE,Hypertension can lead to heart failure,81\r\n4553,HYPERTENSION,ATRIAL FIBRILLATION,Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation,81\r\n4554,HYPERTENSION,SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE,Elevated systolic blood pressure is a key diagnostic criterion for hypertension,81\r\n4555,HYPERTENSION,DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE,Elevated diastolic blood pressure is a key diagnostic criterion for hypertension,81\r\n4556,HYPERTENSION,LIFESTYLE FACTORS,Lifestyle factors can directly influence hypertension development,81\r\n4557,HYPERTENSION,PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS,Psychosocial factors may contribute to hypertension development,81\r\n4558,HYPERTENSION,LABORATORY TESTS,Laboratory tests are used to diagnose and monitor hypertension,81\r\n4579,HYPERTENSION,TARGET ORGAN DAMAGE,Long-term hypertension causes damage to multiple organ systems,81\r\n4580,HYPERTENSION,ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS,These medications are specifically used to control hypertension,81\r\n4589,SPIRONOLACTONE,HYPERTENSION,Spironolactone is used in specific cases of hypertension,81\r\n4590,LOOP DIURETIC,HYPERTENSION,Loop diuretics are used in specific cases of hypertension,81\r\n4591,HYPERTENSION,NSAIDS,NSAIDs can interfere with blood pressure control in hypertensive patients,81\r\n4595,HYPERTENSION,CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS,Calcium channel blockers are used in the treatment of hypertension as part of the medication regimen,81\r\n4766,HYPERTENSION,DASH DIET,\"The DASH diet is specifically designed to help manage hypertension\nThe DASH diet is specifically designed to lower blood pressure\",81\r\n2726,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,CHOLESTEROL,\"**ATHEROSCLEROSIS and CHOLESTEROL**  \n\nAtherosclerosis is a cardiovascular condition characterized by the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can lead to reduced blood flow and increased risk of heart disease and stroke. Cholesterol plays a critical role in this process, with its effects varying depending on the type. High-density lipoprotein (HDL), often referred to as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol, helps prevent atherosclerosis by removing excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and transporting it to the liver for excretion. In contrast, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or \"\"bad\"\" cholesterol, contributes to the development of atherosclerosis when present in excess. Elevated levels of LDL can lead to the accumulation of cholesterol in arterial walls, forming plaque and narrowing the arteries. Therefore, maintaining a balance between HDL and LDL cholesterol is essential in reducing the risk of atherosclerosis. Excess cholesterol, particularly LDL, is a key factor in the progression of this disease.  \n\nThis summary integrates both descriptions, clarifying the distinct roles of HDL and LDL cholesterol in either preventing or promoting atherosclerosis while emphasizing the importance of cholesterol management in cardiovascular health.\",79\r\n3078,ARTERIOSCLEROSIS,STROKE,\"**ARTERIOSCLEROSIS and STROKE**  \n\nArteriosclerosis, a condition characterized by the thickening and hardening of the arteries, can have severe consequences when it affects the brain's blood vessels. This narrowing and stiffening of the arteries restrict blood flow, increasing the risk of stroke—a sudden interruption of blood supply to the brain. Research indicates that arteriosclerosis significantly elevates the likelihood of stroke, as it can lead to blockages or ruptures in the affected vessels, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients.  \n\nThe relationship between arteriosclerosis and stroke is well-established, with the former serving as a major contributing factor to the latter. By impairing vascular health, arteriosclerosis creates conditions where strokes are more likely to occur, emphasizing the importance of managing cardiovascular risk factors to prevent both conditions.\",77\r\n2862,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,High blood pressure and high lipidemia are both risk factors for cardiovascular diseases,66\r\n2948,HIGH LIPID BLOOD DISEASE,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,High lipid blood disease is a risk factor for coronary heart disease,62\r\n3201,PRAVASTATIN,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,Pravastatin is a prescribed medication for treating high lipidemia,61\r\n2071,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE,\"**HIGH LIPIDEMIA and TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE**  \n\nTraditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers a holistic perspective on high lipidemia, addressing its causes, mechanisms, diagnosis, and treatment. According to TCM, high lipidemia arises from imbalances in the body's internal systems, often linked to dietary habits, lifestyle factors, and underlying syndromes such as spleen deficiency, phlegm-dampness accumulation, or blood stasis. TCM categorizes high lipidemia under specific pathological patterns, enabling tailored diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.  \n\nTreatment in TCM emphasizes a combination of herbal remedies, acupuncture, dietary modifications, and lifestyle adjustments. Herbal formulations may target spleen strengthening, phlegm resolution, or blood circulation improvement, depending on the diagnosed syndrome. Dietary recommendations often include reducing greasy or sweet foods while incorporating ingredients believed to regulate lipid metabolism, such as hawthorn, turmeric, or coix seed. Lifestyle advice may involve stress reduction techniques and moderate physical activity to restore balance.  \n\nBy integrating these methods, TCM aims not only to manage lipid levels but also to address the root causes of imbalance, promoting long-term health. This approach contrasts with conventional medicine's focus on direct lipid-lowering interventions, offering a complementary or alternative pathway for patients. The combination of syndrome differentiation and personalized treatment underscores TCM's unique contribution to managing high lipidemia.\",59\r\n2999,HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,TRIGLYCERIDES,HDL levels show negative correlation with triglyceride levels in smokers,58\r\n3345,HIGH BLOOD LIPID DISEASE,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,High blood lipid disease is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease,57\r\n2749,LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CHOLESTEROL,LDL carries cholesterol into surrounding tissues,56\r\n2751,HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CHOLESTEROL,HDL transports cholesterol from tissues back to the liver,56\r\n3572,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,VEGETABLE OIL,\"Vegetable oil is recommended to replace animal fats in the diet for high lipidemia patients\nVegetable oil is recommended to replace animal fats in high lipidemia diets\",56\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
