This arterial narrowing restricts blood flow to the heart, potentially leading to serious complications such as heart attacks, myocardial ischemia, or sudden death.  \n\nCHD is closely linked to **high lipid levels**, particularly elevated **low-density lipoprotein (LDL)** and **very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)**, as well as reduced **high-density lipoprotein (HDL)**, which exacerbates atherosclerosis. Other contributing factors include **high cholesterol**, **triglycerides**, **hypertension**, **diabetes**, **obesity**, **smoking**, and **unhealthy dietary habits**—such as excessive intake of saturated and trans fats. Lifestyle modifications, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and smoking cessation, can mitigate risks.  \n\nThe disease's progression is influenced by **age**, **gender**, and **family history**, with varying incidence rates between men and women. Additionally, conditions like **hyperlipidemia** and **hypertension** further elevate CHD risk. Early detection through lipid profile assessments and management of underlying risk factors are critical in preventing severe outcomes.  \n\nIn summary, CHD arises from a combination of **atherosclerosis**, **dyslipidemia**, and **lifestyle factors**, underscoring the importance of proactive cardiovascular health management.\",29\r\n2277,HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"**High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)** is a type of cholesterol often referred to as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol due to its protective effects on cardiovascular health. It functions primarily to remove excess cholesterol from blood vessels and tissues, helping to prevent arterial hardening and atherosclerosis, earning it the nickname \"\"anti-atherosclerotic lipoprotein.\"\" HDL works by transporting other forms of cholesterol, such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL), away from the bloodstream and arterial walls, reducing the risk of plaque buildup and improving heart health.  \n\nIn addition to its role in cholesterol clearance, HDL is associated with broader health benefits. Studies indicate that reduced HDL levels may be linked to adverse outcomes in stroke patients and hypertension, particularly in animal models. Elevated HDL levels, on the other hand, are correlated with improved cardiovascular outcomes and can be achieved through lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, weight loss, smoking cessation, and dietary adjustments.  \n\nWhile HDL is universally recognized as beneficial, its mechanisms extend beyond cholesterol transport, influencing inflammation and endothelial function. Its multifaceted role underscores its importance in maintaining cardiovascular health and mitigating disease risks.\",7\r\n2663,SATURATED FATTY ACIDS,\"Saturated fatty acids are found in animal meats, dairy products, and animal fats, and are known to raise blood lipids and increase the risk of heart disease\"\"\",1\r\n2739,PRIMARY PREVENTION,\"Primary prevention involves lowering cholesterol in individuals with risk factors for coronary heart disease but no existing condition.\"\"\",1\r\n2740,SECONDARY PREVENTION,\"Secondary prevention involves lowering cholesterol in individuals already diagnosed with coronary heart disease to prevent further complications.\"\"\",1\r\n2741,ANGINA,\"Chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscles, often a symptom of coronary artery disease\",1\r\n2329,LIPOPROTEIN(A),\"Lipoprotein(a) is an independent lipoprotein that can cause arteriosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and myocardial infarction when levels are elevated>\",3\r\n2312,HIGH LIPID LEVELS,\"**HIGH LIPID LEVELS (Hyperlipidemia)**  \n\nHigh lipid levels, also referred to as hyperlipidemia, are characterized by elevated concentrations of lipids—including cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)—in the blood. This condition is a significant risk factor for coronary heart disease and other serious cardiovascular diseases if left untreated. While high lipid levels often present no symptoms in their early stages, prolonged elevation can contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, increasing the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes.  \n\nMedical guidelines provide specific thresholds for cholesterol and LDL levels to assess an individual's risk. For instance, high total cholesterol (typically above 200 mg/dL) and elevated LDL (often termed \"\"bad cholesterol\"\") are key indicators used to determine the need for lifestyle modifications or medical interventions. Management typically involves dietary changes, increased physical activity, and, in some cases, lipid-lowering medications such as statins.  \n\nThe condition underscores the importance of regular screening, as early detection and intervention can mitigate long-term health risks. Despite its asymptomatic nature in initial phases, hyperlipidemia demands proactive management to prevent severe cardiovascular complications.\",3\r\n2293,MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,\"**Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack)**  \n\nMyocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, is a severe medical condition that occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked for an extended period, leading to damage or death of the heart muscle. This blockage is often caused by atherosclerosis, the buildup of fatty deposits (plaques) in the coronary arteries, which restricts blood supply.  \n\nThe condition is strongly associated with coronary heart disease and is frequently linked to elevated levels of lipids in the blood, including very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a). These lipid abnormalities contribute to the development of atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of arterial blockages. Additionally, myocardial infarction is recognized as a severe outcome of coronary heart disease, underscoring the importance of managing cardiovascular risk factors such as high cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes.  \n\nWhile the descriptions vary slightly in emphasis—some highlighting lipid imbalances, others focusing on coronary artery disease—they collectively reinforce that myocardial infarction results from disrupted blood flow to the heart, often due to underlying vascular disease. The condition remains a critical health concern requiring prompt medical intervention to prevent irreversible damage.\",7\r\n2339,ASPIRIN,\"Aspirin is a medication used in cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment, often alongside statins\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1751,HIGH BLOOD LIPIDS,HYPERTENSION,High blood lipids can lead to hypertension,42\r\n1620,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,HYPERLIPIDEMIA,\"**CORONARY HEART DISEASE (CHD)** and **HYPERLIPIDEMIA** are closely interrelated conditions, with hyperlipidemia being a significant risk factor for the development of CHD. Hyperlipidemia, characterized by elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood, contributes to the progression of coronary heart disease by promoting atherosclerosis—the buildup of fatty deposits in the arterial walls. These deposits can narrow or block coronary arteries, impairing blood flow to the heart and increasing the risk of complications such as heart attacks. Both high cholesterol and high triglycerides are recognized as major contributors to CHD, underscoring the importance of managing lipid levels to reduce cardiovascular risk. Together, these descriptions highlight the critical role of lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease.\",41\r\n1646,HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,\"**Summary of HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) and CORONARY HEART DISEASE (CHD):**  \n\nHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL), often referred to as \"\"good cholesterol,\"\" plays a protective role against coronary heart disease (CHD) through multiple mechanisms. Primarily, HDL helps reduce the risk of CHD by removing excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and transporting it to the liver for excretion, thereby preventing the buildup of arterial plaque. This process not only mitigates atherosclerosis—a key contributor to CHD—but also supports overall cardiovascular health.  \n\nAdditionally, research indicates that low levels of HDL are associated with an increased risk of developing CHD, underscoring its importance as a biomarker for cardiovascular risk. The inverse relationship between HDL levels and CHD risk highlights HDL's critical function in maintaining healthy cholesterol balance and protecting against arterial damage.  \n\nIn summary, HDL serves as a vital defense against coronary heart disease by promoting cholesterol clearance, reducing plaque formation, and lowering overall cardiovascular risk. Maintaining adequate HDL levels is therefore essential for heart health.\",36\r\n2082,SATURATED FATTY ACIDS,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,\"Saturated fatty acids contribute to elevated blood lipids, increasing the risk of coronary heart disease\",30\r\n2104,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,PRIMARY PREVENTION,Primary prevention aims to reduce the risk of developing coronary heart disease.,30\r\n2105,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,SECONDARY PREVENTION,Secondary prevention aims to manage and reduce complications in individuals already diagnosed with coronary heart disease.,30\r\n2108,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,ANGINA,Angina is a symptom of coronary heart disease,30\r\n1748,ARTERIOSCLEROSIS,LIPOPROTEIN(A),Elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) can cause arteriosclerosis,14\r\n1774,HIGH LIPID LEVELS,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,High lipid levels are a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases,12\r\n1750,MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,LIPOPROTEIN(A),Elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) can cause myocardial infarction,10\r\n1764,ASPIRIN,MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,Aspirin is used to prevent myocardial infarction in patients with cardiovascular disease,8\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
