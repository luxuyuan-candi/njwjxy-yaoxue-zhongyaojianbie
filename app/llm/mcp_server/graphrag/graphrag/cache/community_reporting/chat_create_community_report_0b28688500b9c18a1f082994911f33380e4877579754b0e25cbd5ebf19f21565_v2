These interventions encompass a broad range of strategies tailored to manage specific conditions, including hypertension, cardiovascular risk, and mental health disorders such as depression.  \n\nKey components of lifestyle interventions include **dietary modifications**, such as adopting heart-healthy eating patterns (e.g., reduced sodium intake, increased consumption of fruits and vegetables) to lower blood pressure and cardiovascular risk. **Physical activity** is another critical element, promoting cardiovascular health, weight management, and mental well-being. Additionally, **stress management techniques**, such as mindfulness or relaxation exercises, are often incorporated to mitigate the physiological and psychological effects of chronic stress.  \n\nFor mental health, particularly depression, lifestyle interventions emphasize **regular exercise**, which has been shown to alleviate symptoms by boosting mood-regulating neurotransmitters. **Sleep hygiene** practices—such as maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and optimizing the sleep environment—are also recommended to improve emotional regulation. Furthermore, **substance avoidance**, including limiting alcohol and tobacco use, is encouraged to reduce exacerbating factors in depressive disorders.  \n\nWhile the focus may vary depending on the targeted condition (e.g., cardiovascular health vs. mental health), lifestyle interventions share a common goal: empowering individuals to adopt sustainable, health-promoting behaviors without relying solely on pharmacological treatments. These approaches are often integrated into comprehensive care plans to enhance overall well-being.\",7\r\n1184,SODIUM INTAKE,,2\r\n1176,POTASSIUM INTAKE,\"Recommendation to increase potassium intake as part of hypertension management\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n977,LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION,SODIUM INTAKE,Sodium reduction is a component of lifestyle intervention,9\r\n980,POTASSIUM INTAKE,SODIUM INTAKE,Both are dietary recommendations for hypertension management,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
