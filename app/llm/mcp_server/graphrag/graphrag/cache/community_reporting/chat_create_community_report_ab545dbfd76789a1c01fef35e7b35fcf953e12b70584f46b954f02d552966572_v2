This condition is a severe and potentially life-threatening type of stroke, as the accumulated blood can increase pressure on the brain, causing damage to surrounding areas and impairing vital functions. It is closely linked to cardiovascular health, often arising from conditions such as hypertension (high blood pressure), aneurysms, or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which weaken blood vessel walls over time.  \n\nThe rupture of these vessels disrupts normal blood flow and oxygen supply to the brain, resulting in rapid neurological deterioration. Symptoms may include sudden severe headache, weakness or numbness in the face or limbs, difficulty speaking, loss of coordination, or altered consciousness. Immediate medical intervention is critical to minimize brain damage and improve survival outcomes.  \n\nAs a subtype of stroke, cerebral hemorrhage underscores the importance of managing cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption, to reduce the likelihood of such events. Treatment may involve surgical intervention, medication to control bleeding and pressure, and long-term rehabilitation to address neurological deficits.\",3\r\n3485,BRAIN INFARCTION,\"Brain infarction occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked, causing brain cell death and potentially leading to paralysis or speech impairment\",2\r\n3487,ANGINA PECTORIS,Angina pectoris is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle due to coronary artery narrowing,2\r\n3488,ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,\"Acute myocardial infarction occurs when blood flow to part of the heart is completely blocked, causing heart muscle death\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3301,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,ARTERIAL HARDENING,High cholesterol directly causes arterial hardening by depositing plaques in blood vessel walls,44\r\n3306,CEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE,ARTERIAL HARDENING,\"Arterial hardening weakens blood vessel walls, increasing risk of cerebral hemorrhage\",9\r\n3304,BRAIN INFARCTION,ARTERIAL HARDENING,Arterial hardening can lead to brain infarction by narrowing cerebral arteries and promoting clot formation,8\r\n3307,ANGINA PECTORIS,ARTERIAL HARDENING,\"Arterial hardening in coronary arteries reduces blood flow to the heart, causing angina pectoris\",8\r\n3309,ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,ARTERIAL HARDENING,\"Severe arterial hardening can completely block coronary arteries, causing acute myocardial infarction\",8\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
