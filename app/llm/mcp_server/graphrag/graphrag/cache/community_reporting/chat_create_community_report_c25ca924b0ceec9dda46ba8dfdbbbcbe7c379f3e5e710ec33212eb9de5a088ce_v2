Recognized as both a food and medicinal substance, it holds significant health benefits and is commonly incorporated into recipes for its therapeutic properties.  \n\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, 山楂 is valued for its ability to aid digestion, reduce blood lipids, resolve blood stasis, and soften blood vessels. It is a key ingredient in foundational prescriptions for treating hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol) and is particularly effective for specific syndromes, including phlegm-turbidity obstruction, phlegm-stasis interaction, qi stagnation and blood stasis, qi deficiency and blood stasis, liver-kidney yin deficiency, and spleen deficiency with dampness accumulation.  \n\nAs a dual-purpose herb, 山楂 is not only utilized in medicinal formulations but also consumed as a functional food to promote overall wellness. Its applications span from alleviating digestive issues to managing cardiovascular conditions, making it a versatile and integral component of both dietary and therapeutic practices in Chinese culture.  \n\nThe fruit’s multifaceted benefits—ranging from lipid-lowering effects to vascular protection—underscore its importance in holistic health management.
