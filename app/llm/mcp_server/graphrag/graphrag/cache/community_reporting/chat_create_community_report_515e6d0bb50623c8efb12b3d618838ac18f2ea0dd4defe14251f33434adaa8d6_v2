It can be classified as **ischemic** (due to blocked blood vessels) or **hemorrhagic** (due to bleeding in the brain). Hypertension (high blood pressure) is a major risk factor for stroke, and controlling blood pressure through antihypertensive treatment is crucial for reducing both the risk of occurrence and recurrence.  \n\nStroke is also associated with other conditions, including **metabolic syndrome**, **high lipid levels**, **aortic stenosis** (due to altered cerebral hemodynamics), and **atrial fibrillation**, where anticoagulation therapies such as NOACs and warfarin are used to prevent stroke. Additionally, **folic acid therapy** (as demonstrated in the CSPPT trial) has been shown to help prevent stroke in certain populations.  \n\nBeyond its physiological causes, stroke is studied in relation to **depression** and is a leading cause of death, particularly in China, where it is the most common type of cardiovascular disease. Research on stroke and related conditions is published in dedicated scientific journals.  \n\nIn summary, stroke is a serious medical condition with multiple risk factors, complications, and preventive strategies, emphasizing the importance of blood pressure management and targeted therapies.\",27\n1533,RANKIN SCALE,\"A clinical scale used to measure disability and dependence in stroke patients\"\"\",1\n2180,MARKIDAN J,\"A researcher involved in a study on smoking and the risk of ischemic stroke in young men>\nResearcher who studied smoking and risk of ischemic stroke>\",1\n2181,COLE JW,\"A researcher involved in a study on smoking and the risk of ischemic stroke in young men>\nResearcher who studied smoking and risk of ischemic stroke>\",1\n2182,CRONIN CA,\"A researcher involved in a study on smoking and the risk of ischemic stroke in young men>\nResearcher who studied smoking and risk of ischemic stroke>\",1\n3312,中华医学会神经病学分会,\"The Chinese Medical Association's Neurology Branch, responsible for guidelines on stroke prevention and treatment\"\"\",1\n1150,ISCHEMIC STROKE,\"**ISCHEMIC STROKE** is a type of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event characterized by blocked blood flow to the brain, typically due to arterial blockages.
