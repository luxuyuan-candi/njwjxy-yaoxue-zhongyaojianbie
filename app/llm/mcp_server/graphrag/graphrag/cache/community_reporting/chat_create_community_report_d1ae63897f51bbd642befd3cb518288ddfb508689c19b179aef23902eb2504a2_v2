HDL accounts for approximately 25% of total cholesterol in the body and plays a crucial role in transporting excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver for processing and excretion, a process known as reverse cholesterol transport. This mechanism helps prevent the buildup of cholesterol in arterial walls, thereby reducing the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.  \n\nHDL is widely recognized for its protective effects on the cardiovascular system. Low levels of HDL are associated with a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, while elevated levels are linked to improved heart health. HDL also activates key enzymes involved in lipoprotein metabolism, further aiding in cholesterol clearance.  \n\nThe measurement of HDL levels is typically expressed in millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Lifestyle factors, such as regular exercise, can increase HDL concentrations, enhancing its cardioprotective benefits. Due to its role in reducing cardiovascular risk, maintaining healthy HDL levels is an important aspect of preventive healthcare.  \n\nIn summary, High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is a beneficial form of cholesterol that supports cardiovascular health by facilitating cholesterol removal, preventing arterial plaque formation, and lowering the risk of heart disease. Its levels can be improved through physical activity, underscoring the importance of lifestyle in maintaining optimal HDL function.\",10\r\n3267,LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR,Lipoprotein receptors on cell surfaces interact with lipoproteins to regulate cholesterol metabolism>,2\r\n3475,TAIWAN MAKAY,\"Taiwan Makay is an institution with experience in weight control, noting that weight loss can lead to reduced blood cholesterol levels>\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2751,HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CHOLESTEROL,HDL transports cholesterol from tissues back to the liver,56\r\n2830,LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR,Low-density lipoprotein binds to lipoprotein receptors to deliver cholesterol to cells,12\r\n3280,HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,TAIWAN MAKAY,Taiwan Makay's weight control programs have observed a correlation between weight loss and improved HDL levels,12\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
