It is particularly effective in treating **hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol)**, especially for patterns such as **phlegm-turbidity obstruction (痰浊内阻型)**, **phlegm-stasis intermingling (痰瘀互结型)**, **qi stagnation and blood stasis (气滞血瘀型)**, **qi deficiency and blood stasis (气虚血瘀型)**, **liver-kidney yin deficiency (肝肾阴虚型)**, and **spleen deficiency with dampness (脾虚湿盛型)**. Its therapeutic properties include **promoting digestion, reducing blood lipids, resolving stasis, and softening blood vessels**.  \n\nAs a **food-medicine substance (食药物质)**, 山楂 is incorporated into various **dishes, teas, and health-promoting recipes** due to its dual role as a flavor enhancer and functional ingredient. Its tart flavor makes it a popular addition to beverages and culinary preparations, while its **health benefits**—such as aiding digestion and supporting cardiovascular health—reinforce its widespread use.  \n\nIn summary, 山楂 is a **multifunctional** ingredient valued in both TCM and cuisine, serving as a natural remedy for metabolic and circulatory disorders while also enriching dietary practices.
