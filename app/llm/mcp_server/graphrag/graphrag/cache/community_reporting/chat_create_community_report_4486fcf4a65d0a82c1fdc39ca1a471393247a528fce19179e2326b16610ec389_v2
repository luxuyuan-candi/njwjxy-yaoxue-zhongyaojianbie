This condition significantly increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events, including heart attacks, strokes, and other complications. ASCVD is the leading cause of death among urban and rural residents in China, accounting for over 40% of fatalities.  \n\nASCVD risk is assessed through stratification methods, categorizing individuals as low, medium, or high risk based on factors such as smoking, low HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), age, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. This risk assessment is particularly important for Chinese adults, guiding management strategies that include lifestyle interventions (e.g., diet, exercise) and medication, such as statins and PCSK9 inhibitors for high-risk patients.  \n\nThe condition is closely linked to lipid abnormalities, with lipid-lowering treatments being a primary therapeutic approach. Key biomarkers like ApoB (apolipoprotein B) and LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) are used to predict ASCVD risk and determine target values for patients, especially those with comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes. Regular lipid monitoring is essential for prevention and treatment.  \n\nASCVD is also referred to as **Arteriosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease**, emphasizing its association with cholesterol levels and overall cardiovascular health. While terminology may vary slightly, the core definition remains consistent: a progressive disease driven by plaque accumulation, necessitating proactive risk assessment and targeted therapies to mitigate adverse outcomes.  \n\nIn summary, ASCVD is a major global health concern, requiring comprehensive risk evaluation, lipid management, and tailored interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality.\",49\r\n4516,MIXED HYPERLIPIDEMIA,\"**MIXED HYPERLIPIDEMIA**  \n\nMixed hyperlipidemia is a metabolic disorder characterized by the concurrent elevation of both cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. This condition is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) due to the combined effects of high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Management typically requires a combination of pharmacological therapies, as single-agent treatments may not adequately address both lipid abnormalities. The disorder underscores the importance of comprehensive lipid-lowering strategies to mitigate cardiovascular risks.  \n\nThe two provided descriptions align in their definition of mixed hyperlipidemia as a dual elevation of cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as its clinical implications for ASCVD risk. Both also emphasize the necessity of combination drug therapy for effective management, reinforcing the complexity of treating this condition. The summary consolidates these points into a coherent overview without contradictions.\",8\r\n3582,冠状动脉旁路移植术,\"冠状动脉旁路移植术（Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting, CABG），也称为冠状动脉搭桥手术，是一种用于治疗严重动脉粥样硬化性心血管疾病（ASCVD）或冠心病的手术方法。该手术通过从患者身体其他部位（如胸壁或腿部）取一段健康的血管，将其移植到冠状动脉狭窄或阻塞的部位，以绕过病变区域，恢复心肌的正常血液供应。冠状动脉旁路移植术适用于多支血管病变、左主干病变或药物治疗效果不佳的患者，能够有效缓解心绞痛症状，改善心脏功能，并降低心肌梗死的风险。该手术是冠心病治疗的重要手段之一，尤其适用于病情复杂或严重的病例。\",2\r\n2074,RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT),,1\r\n2981,ARTERIOSCLEROTIC CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE,\"Full name of ASCVD, a cardiovascular condition addressed in the lipid management guidelines\"\"\",1\r\n2983,CABG,Coronary artery bypass grafting is a surgical procedure for treating coronary artery disease,1\r\n2986,CHINESE ADULTS,\"Chinese adults are the target population for the ASCVD risk assessment and management strategies outlined.\"\"\",1\r\n3002,新发糖尿病,\"New-onset diabetes, a potential long-term risk associated with high-dose statin use\"\"\",1\r\n4524,SCORE CARDIOVASCULAR RISK SCALE,\"A risk assessment tool proposed by European dyslipidemia treatment guidelines for evaluating cardiovascular disease risk\"\"\",1\r\n4525,CANADIAN CARDIOVASCULAR LIFE EXPECTANCY MODEL,\"A model used internationally for cardiovascular disease risk assessment\"\"\",1\r\n4526,CORONARY ARTERY CALCIUM SCORE,\"A scoring system used in cardiovascular disease risk assessment\"\"\",1\r\n4527,US POOLED COHORT EQUATIONS,\"A risk assessment tool used internationally for cardiovascular disease risk evaluation\"\"\",1\r\n4528,METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION-ASSOCIATED FATTY LIVER DISEASE,\"A condition correlated with insulin resistance and high TG levels\"\"\",1\r\n4531,急性冠状动脉综合征,\"Acute coronary syndrome, a severe ASCVD event used for risk stratification\"\"\",1\r\n4532,经皮冠状动脉介入治疗,\"Percutaneous coronary intervention, a procedure for ASCVD management\"\"\",1\r\n2984,PCI,Percutaneous coronary intervention is a minimally invasive procedure to treat coronary artery disease,1\r\n4534,高敏C反应蛋白,\"High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) is a biomarker for inflammation, with levels ≥2.0 mg/L indicating higher ASCVD risk\"\"\",1\r\n4535,冠状动脉钙化,\"Coronary artery calcium scoring ≥100 AU is a marker of ASCVD risk\"\"\",1\r\n4536,踝/臂血压指数,\"Ankle-brachial index (ABI) <0.9 is a marker of peripheral artery disease and ASCVD risk\"\"\",1\r\n2044,CVD,\"CVD stands for Cardiovascular Disease, a broad term for heart and blood vessel disorders\"\"\",4\r\n4530,LDL?C,\"Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a primary biomarker and intervention target for lipid management\",4\r\n2065,FAMILIAL HYPERLIPIDEMIA,\"**Familial Hyperlipidemia** is an inherited genetic disorder characterized by abnormally high levels of lipids (fats) in the blood due to mutations passed down through families. This condition disrupts normal lipid metabolism, leading to elevated cholesterol and/or triglycerides, which increases the risk of early cardiovascular disease. The disorder is caused by genetic mutations that impair the body's ability to properly process and clear lipids from the bloodstream. While descriptions vary slightly in phrasing, they consistently emphasize its hereditary nature, the abnormal lipid accumulation, and its association with heightened cardiovascular risks. There are no significant contradictions in the provided descriptions—all agree that familial hyperlipidemia is a genetic condition with significant implications for heart health.

Risk stratification tools incorporate LDL-C measurements to determine individualized target values for patients, ensuring tailored therapeutic approaches. Elevated LDL-C levels are strongly associated with increased ASCVD risk, making their reduction a cornerstone of preventive strategies.  \n\nMultiple descriptions highlight the critical role of LDL-C in assessing and managing ASCVD risk, reinforcing its dual function as a diagnostic marker and a modifiable treatment target.
