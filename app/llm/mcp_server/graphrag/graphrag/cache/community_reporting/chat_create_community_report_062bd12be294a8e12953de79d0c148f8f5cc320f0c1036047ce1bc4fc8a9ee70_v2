They are also effective in treating coronary syndromes and heart failure, making them versatile in cardiovascular care. Among the various types, selective β1 blockers are often preferred for elderly patients due to their targeted action. Additionally, beta-blockers are considered a first-line treatment for hypertensive patients with elevated heart rates, as they help regulate both blood pressure and heart rate.  \n\nThis summary integrates all provided descriptions, highlighting the key therapeutic uses and considerations for beta-blockers without contradictions.\",9\n1095,ACEI,\"**ACEI (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor)** is a class of antihypertensive drugs that inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, thereby relaxing blood vessels and lowering blood pressure. ACEIs are widely used to treat **hypertension** and are particularly recommended for patients with comorbid conditions such as **diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), proteinuria, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), chronic heart failure (HFrEF), chronic coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and peripheral artery disease (PAD)**. They improve prognosis in **heart failure patients** by reducing hospitalization rates and mortality and may also enhance walking distance in **PAD patients with hypertension**.  \n\nACEIs are considered **first-line therapy** for hypertension in **diabetic patients**, as they help protect target organs without worsening metabolic conditions. They are also recommended for **systemic lupus erythematosus and scleroderma renal crisis**. However, they should **not be combined with ARBs (Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers) or direct renin inhibitors** due to increased risks of **kidney events and hyperkalemia**. Additionally, ACEIs are **contraindicated in pregnancy** due to potential fetal risks and should be **discontinued one day before surgery** to avoid **intraoperative hypotension**.  \n\nWhen transitioning from ACEIs to **ARNIs (Angiotensin Receptor-Neprilysin Inhibitors)**, a washout period of **at least 36 hours** is required. Some studies suggest ACEIs may also be associated with a **reduced risk of mood disorders**. Common examples of ACEIs include **captopril and fosinopril**, which are also used in pediatric hypertension management.  \n\nIn summary, ACEIs are a versatile class of **RAS inhibitors** with broad applications in cardiovascular and renal diseases, serving as a foundational therapy in **combined antihypertensive regimens**, especially for high-risk patients.\",53\n1096,ARB,\"**ARB (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers)** are a class of antihypertensive medications that block the AT1 receptor, inhibiting the effects of angiotensin II to relax blood vessels and lower blood pressure. They are widely used to treat **hypertension (high blood pressure)**, **heart failure (particularly HFrEF, where they improve prognosis and reduce hospitalization and mortality rates)**, and **diabetic nephropathy**, while also providing **organ protection in diabetic patients**.  \n\nARBs are recommended as **first-line therapy** for various patient groups, including those with **peripheral arterial disease (PAD)**, **lower extremity arterial disease**, **obesity**, **chronic kidney disease (CKD) with proteinuria**, and **autoimmune conditions** where ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) are not tolerated. They are also suggested as an **alternative to ACEIs** for patients experiencing side effects like **dry cough**.  \n\nAdditionally, ARBs may offer **benefits beyond blood pressure control**, such as **reducing the risk of mood disorders**, **improving hyperuricemia**, and serving as a **base for combined antihypertensive therapy in diabetic patients with hypertension**. However, they **should not be combined with ACEIs or direct renin inhibitors** due to potential adverse effects like **hyperkalemia and kidney events**.  \n\nPrecautions include **discontinuing ARBs before surgery** to avoid **hypotension (low blood pressure)** and **avoiding use in pregnancy** due to potential risks. Common ARBs include **losartan**, which is also used in pediatric hypertension management.  \n\nIn summary, ARBs are a versatile class of **RAS inhibitors** with broad applications in **cardiovascular and renal protection**, particularly in high-risk populations such as those with **diabetes, obesity, or heart failure**.\",48\n1101,噻嗪类利尿剂,**噻嗪类利尿剂 (Thiazide Diuretics)** 是一类用于治疗高血压的传统降压药物，主要通过减少体液潴留来发挥降压作用。作为血压管理的一线药物，噻嗪类利尿剂被广泛应用于临床。然而，长期使用此类药物可能对血糖控制产生不利影响，需在治疗过程中予以监测。其降压机制明确，疗效显著，是高血压治疗中的重要选择之一。,6\n1296,二氢吡啶类CCB,\"Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are a class of medications used to treat hypertension by relaxing blood vessels\"\"\",3\n1152,CHRONIC CORONARY HEART DISEASE,\"**CHRONIC CORONARY HEART DISEASE** is a condition characterized by the narrowing of the coronary arteries, which reduces blood flow to the heart. This impairment in blood supply can lead to various cardiovascular complications. Notably, chronic coronary heart disease is one of the conditions where **angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)** are particularly effective as part of the treatment regimen. The combination of arterial narrowing and the therapeutic potential of ACEIs underscores the importance of targeted management for this chronic condition.\",2\n1153,PROTEINURIA,\"**PROTEINURIA** is a medical condition characterized by excessive protein in the urine. It can be effectively managed with certain treatments, including **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**, which have been shown to improve the condition.
