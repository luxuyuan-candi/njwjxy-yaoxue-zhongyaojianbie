They are considered the first-line treatment for patients with arteriosclerosis and high-risk groups due to their efficacy in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, moderately reducing very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglycerides, and slightly increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels.  \n\nIn addition to cholesterol reduction, statins help stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. They are particularly effective in treating hypercholesterolemia and are often combined with other lipid-lowering agents for managing mixed hyperlipidemia. Commonly prescribed statins include **Lovastatin, Simvastatin, Pravastatin, and Atorvastatin**.  \n\nStatins are generally well-tolerated and do not exhibit significant interactions with antihypertensive medications, making them suitable for patients with concurrent hypertension.
