This condition often arises due to underlying hypertension and requires distinct management approaches compared to other forms of heart failure. Treatment recommendations may include the use of **ARBs (Angiotensin Receptor Blockers)** to address the condition. HFpEF represents a significant clinical challenge due to its complex pathophysiology and the need for tailored therapeutic strategies.\",8\n1550,ANGINA,\"Chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart\"\"\",2\n935,AOBP,Automated Office Blood Pressure (AOBP) is a method for measuring blood pressure in a controlled environment to reduce white-coat effect,2\n892,MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION,\"**Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack)** is a severe coronary event and a type of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) characterized by heart tissue damage due to blocked blood flow. It is a major medical condition studied in research on beta-blocker efficacy and is included in ASCVD risk classification. Hypertension is a significant risk factor for myocardial infarction, and elevated blood pressure levels increase the likelihood of such events. When combined with hypertension, myocardial infarction can lead to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Additionally, it is one of the conditions where angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are particularly effective. Post-myocardial infarction management often involves the use of angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) and other medications to improve outcomes.  \n\nThis summary integrates all provided descriptions into a coherent overview, resolving any overlaps or contradictions by consolidating related information.\",7\n900,HFREF,\"**HFrEF (Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction)** is a medical condition characterized by the heart's diminished or impaired ability to pump blood effectively due to a reduced ejection fraction. This decline in pumping efficiency can result from various underlying causes, including hypertension when combined with coronary artery disease or a history of myocardial infarction. The condition is marked by the heart's inability to meet the body's circulatory demands, leading to symptoms associated with heart failure. While the descriptions vary slightly in phrasing, they consistently emphasize the reduced pumping capacity of the heart as the defining feature of HFrEF.\",13\n903,CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE,\"**Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)** is a cardiovascular condition characterized by the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. This condition is strongly associated with hypertension (high blood pressure), and their coexistence can exacerbate cardiovascular complications. In particular, when combined with hypertension, CAD may contribute to the development of **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**, a serious condition where the heart's ability to pump blood is impaired. Overall, CAD is a significant health concern due to its role in restricting blood flow to the heart and its potential to worsen when paired with other risk factors like hypertension.\",4\n934,SPRINT,\"The **Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)** is a clinical trial conducted in the U.S. that investigated the effects of intensive versus standard blood pressure lowering strategies in hypertensive patients. The study specifically examined outcomes such as cardiovascular events, including heart failure incidence, and provided evidence supporting the benefits of intensive blood pressure management. SPRINT also focused on isolated systolic hypertension treatment and included a subgroup analysis of elderly hypertensive patients aged 75 and above, demonstrating consistent cardiovascular benefits from intensive降压治疗 (blood pressure-lowering therapy) regardless of frailty status. The trial serves as a key reference for evaluating blood pressure management strategies in diverse patient populations.\",13\n1557,心力衰竭 D 期,心力衰竭 D 期 is an advanced stage of heart failure characterized by low blood pressure and poor organ perfusion,1\n3074,KJEKSHUS JK,\"KJEKSHUS JK is a researcher focused on studying the efficacy of beta-blockers in the context of myocardial infarction, particularly in both acute and long-term intervention trials.
