It is a major medical condition studied in research on beta-blocker efficacy and is included in ASCVD risk classification. Hypertension is a significant risk factor for myocardial infarction, and elevated blood pressure levels increase the likelihood of such events. When combined with hypertension, myocardial infarction can lead to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Additionally, it is one of the conditions where angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are particularly effective. Post-myocardial infarction management often involves the use of angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) and other medications to improve outcomes.  \n\nThis summary integrates all provided descriptions into a coherent overview, resolving any overlaps or contradictions by consolidating related information.\",7\n903,CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE,\"**Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)** is a cardiovascular condition characterized by the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart muscle. This condition is strongly associated with hypertension (high blood pressure), and their coexistence can exacerbate cardiovascular complications. In particular, when combined with hypertension, CAD may contribute to the development of **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)**, a serious condition where the heart's ability to pump blood is impaired. Overall, CAD is a significant health concern due to its role in restricting blood flow to the heart and its potential to worsen when paired with other risk factors like hypertension.\",4\n3074,KJEKSHUS JK,\"KJEKSHUS JK is a researcher focused on studying the efficacy of beta-blockers in the context of myocardial infarction, particularly in both acute and long-term intervention trials. Their work emphasizes the role of heart rate as a key factor in determining the effectiveness of beta-blocker treatments for this condition. By investigating both short-term and extended outcomes, KJEKSHUS JK contributes to a deeper understanding of how beta-blockers can be optimized for patients suffering from myocardial infarction.\",3\n3081,AM J CARDIOL,\"The *American Journal of Cardiology (AM J CARDIOL)* is a medical journal specializing in publishing research articles related to cardiology.
