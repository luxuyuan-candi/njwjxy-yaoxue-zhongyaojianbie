Elevated levels of 载脂蛋白 月 have been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, as it is a significant component of blood lipids.  \n\nThis protein contributes to the regulation of lipid metabolism, particularly in the transport and distribution of cholesterol and other fats.
