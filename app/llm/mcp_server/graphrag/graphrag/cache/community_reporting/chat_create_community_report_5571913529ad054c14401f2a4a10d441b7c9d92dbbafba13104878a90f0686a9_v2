It is one of the most significant drug-metabolizing enzymes in the human body, influencing the efficacy and safety of numerous medications.  \n\nCYP3A4 is involved in the breakdown of certain statins, and its activity can be inhibited by calcium channel blockers like amlodipine, as well as by grapefruit juice, which can alter the metabolism of drugs that depend on this enzyme. Conversely, the induction of CYP3A4 (e.g., by certain medications or substances) can lead to reduced drug efficacy or increased fluctuations in blood pressure due to accelerated drug clearance.  \n\nWhile CYP3A4 primarily metabolizes many drugs, including some beta-blockers and sedative-hypnotics, it also contributes to the metabolism of R-warfarin, though other enzymes (such as CYP2C9) are more dominant in warfarin metabolism. The descriptions collectively emphasize CYP3A4's broad substrate specificity and its clinical significance in drug interactions, particularly with inhibitors like grapefruit juice or inducers that modulate its activity.  \n\nIn summary, CYP3A4 is a versatile enzyme central to drug metabolism, with implications for therapeutic outcomes, drug interactions, and individualized medication management.\",30\r\n3307,CLARITHROMYCIN,Clarithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,2\r\n3308,ERYTHROMYCIN,Erythromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,2\r\n3279,卡格列净,卡格列净是一种药物，仅有7%经CYP3A4代谢,1\r\n3301,BISOPROLOL,Bisoprolol is a beta-blocker metabolized by CYP3A4,1\r\n3303,ATORVASTATIN,Atorvastatin is a lipophilic statin metabolized by CYP3A4,1\r\n632,KETOCONAZOLE,\"Ketoconazole is an over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections\"\"\",1\r\n3305,POSACONAZOLE,Posaconazole is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n3306,VORICONAZOLE,Voriconazole is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n3309,TELITHROMYCIN,Telithromycin is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n3310,AMIODARONE,Amiodarone is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n3311,AMLODIPINE,Amlodipine is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n3312,VERAPAMIL,Verapamil is a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor,1\r\n3339,利伐沙班,\"Rivaroxaban is an anticoagulant metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2J2, with increased bleeding risk when combined with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors\"\"\",1\r\n2308,SIMVASTATIN,\"**Simvastatin** is a medication primarily used to treat high cholesterol and mixed hyperlipidemia.

As a **lipophilic statin**, simvastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol production in the liver. It is metabolized by the **CYP3A4** enzyme, which plays a key role in its pharmacokinetics and potential drug interactions.  \n\nSimvastatin helps lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, contributing to improved cardiovascular health. Its lipophilic nature allows it to penetrate cell membranes effectively, enhancing its therapeutic action. However, due to its metabolism via CYP3A4, caution is advised when co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., certain antibiotics, antifungals, or grapefruit juice), as this may increase the risk of adverse effects such as myopathy or liver toxicity.  \n\nIn summary, simvastatin is a widely used statin for managing dyslipidemia, available under multiple brand names, with its efficacy and safety influenced by its lipophilic properties and CYP3A4-dependent metabolism.\",5\r\n2596,LOVASTATIN,\"A statin drug with potential adverse effects including headache, gastrointestinal issues, and liver abnormalities\"\"\",4\r\n2597,CLOFIBRATE,\"A lipid-lowering drug with specific contraindications and side effects\"\"\",1\r\n3381,COLCHICINE,A medication for gout that can cause severe toxicity like rhabdomyolysis and renal failure when combined with clarithromycin due to increased AUC from CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibition>,1\r\n3384,CEFTRIAXONE,An antibiotic that can cause disulfiram-like reactions when combined with ethanol>,1\r\n3304,ITRACONAZOLE,Itraconazole is a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor,2\r\n3390,FELODIPINE,\"A calcium channel blocker whose levels are drastically increased by itraconazole, raising the risk of hypotension>\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2678,CYP3A4,CLARITHROMYCIN,Clarithromycin inhibits CYP3A4,32\r\n2679,CYP3A4,ERYTHROMYCIN,Erythromycin inhibits CYP3A4,32\r\n2654,卡格列净,CYP3A4,卡格列净（Canagliflozin）是一种钠-葡萄糖协同转运蛋白2（SGLT2）抑制剂，主要用于治疗2型糖尿病。在代谢途径方面，卡格列净的代谢程度较低，且仅有少量通过细胞色素P450酶CYP3A4进行代谢。具体而言，研究表明卡格列净仅有约7%经CYP3A4代谢，这表明CYP3A4在其代谢过程中作用有限，整体上卡格列净的代谢主要以非CYP途径为主。这一特性可能减少其与其他依赖CYP3A4代谢的药物发生相互作用的潜在风险。,31\r\n2670,CYP3A4,BISOPROLOL,Bisoprolol is metabolized by CYP3A4,31\r\n2673,CYP3A4,ATORVASTATIN,Atorvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4,31\r\n2675,CYP3A4,KETOCONAZOLE,Ketoconazole inhibits CYP3A4,31\r\n2676,CYP3A4,POSACONAZOLE,Posaconazole inhibits CYP3A4,31\r\n2677,CYP3A4,VORICONAZOLE,Voriconazole inhibits CYP3A4,31\r\n2680,CYP3A4,TELITHROMYCIN,Telithromycin inhibits CYP3A4,31\r\n2681,CYP3A4,AMIODARONE,Amiodarone moderately inhibits CYP3A4,31\r\n2682,CYP3A4,AMLODIPINE,Amlodipine moderately inhibits CYP3A4,31\r\n2683,CYP3A4,VERAPAMIL,Verapamil moderately inhibits CYP3A4,31\r\n2740,利伐沙班,CYP3A4,\"Rivaroxaban is metabolized by CYP3A4, increasing bleeding risk with inhibitors\",31\r\n1706,SIMVASTATIN,PRAVASTATIN,\"**SIMVASTATIN and PRAVASTATIN** are statin medications primarily used to treat **high lipidemia** (elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels) by lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and improving overall lipid profiles.
