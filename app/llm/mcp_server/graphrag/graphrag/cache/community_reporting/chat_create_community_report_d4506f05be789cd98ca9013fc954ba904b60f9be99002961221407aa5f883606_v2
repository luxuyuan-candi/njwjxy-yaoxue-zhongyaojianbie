According to TCM, high lipidemia arises from imbalances in the body's internal systems, often linked to dietary habits, lifestyle factors, and underlying syndromes such as spleen deficiency, phlegm-dampness accumulation, or blood stasis. TCM categorizes high lipidemia under specific pathological patterns, enabling tailored diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.  \n\nTreatment in TCM emphasizes a combination of herbal remedies, acupuncture, dietary modifications, and lifestyle adjustments. Herbal formulations may target spleen strengthening, phlegm resolution, or blood circulation improvement, depending on the diagnosed syndrome. Dietary recommendations often include reducing greasy or sweet foods while incorporating ingredients believed to regulate lipid metabolism, such as hawthorn, turmeric, or coix seed. Lifestyle advice may involve stress reduction techniques and moderate physical activity to restore balance.  \n\nBy integrating these methods, TCM aims not only to manage lipid levels but also to address the root causes of imbalance, promoting long-term health. This approach contrasts with conventional medicine's focus on direct lipid-lowering interventions, offering a complementary or alternative pathway for patients.
