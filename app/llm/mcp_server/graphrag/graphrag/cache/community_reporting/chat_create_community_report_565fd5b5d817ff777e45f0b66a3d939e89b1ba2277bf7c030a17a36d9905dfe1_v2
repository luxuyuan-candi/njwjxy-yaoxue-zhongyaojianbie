It is particularly effective for patients experiencing vertigo, nausea, and chest tightness, which are common manifestations of lipid disorders and elevated blood pressure.  \n\nThe formula is renowned for its dual therapeutic effects: it helps regulate lipid levels, addressing hyperlipidemia, while also contributing to the reduction of blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Its composition leverages traditional Chinese medicinal principles to harmonize the body's functions, alleviating symptoms such as dizziness and gastrointestinal discomfort (e.g., nausea).  \n\nWhile the descriptions emphasize slightly different applications—one focusing on hyperlipidemia with vertigo and nausea, and the other highlighting hypertension and lipid regulation—they are complementary rather than contradictory. The formula's versatility allows it to address overlapping metabolic and cardiovascular conditions, making it a valuable remedy in traditional Chinese medicine for patients with these interrelated disorders.  \n\nIn summary, **半夏白术天麻汤** serves as a holistic treatment for metabolic and cardiovascular imbalances, particularly in cases where hyperlipidemia and hypertension coexist, while also providing relief from accompanying symptoms like vertigo and nausea.\",3\r\n2080,温胆汤,\"**温胆汤 (Wen Dan Tang)** is a traditional Chinese medicinal formula primarily used to address hyperlipidemia, often in patients experiencing memory loss or dementia.
