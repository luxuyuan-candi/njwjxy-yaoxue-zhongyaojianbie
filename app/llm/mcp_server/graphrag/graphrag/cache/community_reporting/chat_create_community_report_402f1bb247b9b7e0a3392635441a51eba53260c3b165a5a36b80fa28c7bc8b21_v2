One of its notable complications is its association with elevated lipid levels, including high serum triglycerides and cholesterol, leading to secondary hyperlipidemia. The condition disrupts normal lipid metabolism, often resulting in late-stage hyperlipidemia if left unmanaged. While the descriptions vary slightly in phrasing—referring to \"\"high lipidemia,\"\" \"\"elevated serum triglyceride levels,\"\" or \"\"high cholesterol\"\"—they collectively emphasize that Nephrotic Syndrome frequently contributes to abnormal lipid profiles. This dyslipidemia arises due to increased hepatic lipoprotein synthesis and decreased lipid clearance, further complicating the disorder. Thus, Nephrotic Syndrome is consistently recognized as a significant factor in the development of secondary hyperlipidemia, with implications for cardiovascular risk and long-term kidney function.\",4\r\n1110,SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM,\"The Sympathetic Nervous System contributes to hypertension by increasing heart rate, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance\"\"\",3\r\n1109,RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM,\"The Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) plays a key role in blood pressure regulation by promoting sodium retention and arterial vasoconstriction\"\"\",5\r\n1111,ALDOSTERONE,\"**ALDOSTERONE** is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex, playing a critical role in regulating electrolyte and water balance in the body. It promotes sodium retention in the kidneys, which in turn leads to increased blood volume and elevated blood pressure. By influencing sodium and potassium levels, aldosterone helps maintain homeostasis in fluid and electrolyte concentrations. Its actions are essential for proper cardiovascular and renal function, ensuring stable blood pressure and overall metabolic balance. Together, these functions highlight aldosterone's importance in the endocrine system's regulation of blood pressure and fluid dynamics.\",2\r\n1120,ANGIOTENSINOGEN,,1\r\n1118,PRIMARY HYPERTENSION,\"**Primary Hypertension** is a chronic condition characterized by persistently elevated blood pressure that requires long-term management and regular medical follow-ups. It is defined as hypertension without identifiable secondary causes, such as kidney disease or hormonal disorders, and is primarily driven by dysfunction in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS).  \n\nAs a prevalent form of high blood pressure, primary hypertension often develops gradually over time due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Unlike secondary hypertension, which stems from an underlying medical condition, primary hypertension is diagnosed after ruling out other potential causes. Management typically involves lifestyle modifications (e.g., diet, exercise, stress reduction) and, when necessary, antihypertensive medications to control blood pressure and reduce the risk of complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney damage.  \n\nThe condition underscores the importance of ongoing monitoring and adherence to treatment plans to maintain optimal cardiovascular health.\",3\r\n1214,NATIONAL BASIC PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE,\"Provides guidelines for managing primary hypertension, including follow-up protocols\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n910,KIDNEYS,HYPERTENSION,Impaired renal sodium excretion is a key contributor to hypertension,85\r\n2806,NEPHROTIC SYNDROME,KIDNEYS,Kidney dysfunction can lead to nephrotic syndrome which affects triglycerides,9\r\n908,SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM,KIDNEYS,\"Sympathetic overactivity reduces renal sodium excretion, contributing to hypertension\",8\r\n903,RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM,ALDOSTERONE,\"The RAS stimulates aldosterone secretion, which promotes sodium retention\",7\r\n2785,ALDOSTERONE,ADRENAL CORTEX,The adrenal cortex produces aldosterone.,7\r\n906,RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM,ANGIOTENSINOGEN,Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to initiate the RAS cascade,6\r\n915,PRIMARY HYPERTENSION,SECONDARY HYPERTENSION,Distinct diagnostic categories of hypertension,6\r\n1027,PRIMARY HYPERTENSION,NATIONAL BASIC PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE,The National Basic Public Health Service provides management guidelines for primary hypertension,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
