It is often caused by dietary and lifestyle factors such as excessive alcohol consumption, high-fat diets, lack of exercise, and genetic predisposition. Poor management of these factors can lead to serious health complications, including pancreatitis, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and metabolic disorders. High lipidemia is also a significant global health concern, acting as a \"\"silent killer\"\" and a major contributor to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.  \n\nThe condition is typically managed through dietary adjustments, regular exercise, and medication. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), high lipidemia is classified under categories such as \"\"blood stasis,\"\" \"\"phlegm-dampness,\"\" and \"\"lipid turbidity.\"\" TCM views it as a deficiency-excess syndrome, where phlegm and stasis are the manifestations, while deficiency serves as the root cause.  \n\nGiven its association with multiple systemic health risks, early detection and intervention are crucial to prevent long-term complications. Lifestyle modifications, alongside medical treatment, play a key role in controlling lipid levels and reducing the risk of associated diseases.\",25\r\n2352,KIDNEY DISEASE,\"**Kidney Disease** is a medical condition that can both result from and contribute to other health complications. It is often linked to **hypertension (high blood pressure)**, as prolonged elevated blood pressure can damage the kidneys over time, impairing their function. Conversely, kidney disease can also lead to metabolic disturbances, such as **high lipidemia (elevated levels of lipids in the blood)**, due to the kidneys' role in filtering and regulating bodily fluids and waste. Thus, kidney disease exists in a bidirectional relationship with certain systemic conditions, where it may arise as a consequence of hypertension while also exacerbating or triggering lipid metabolism disorders. Proper management of kidney disease involves addressing both its underlying causes and its potential secondary effects on overall health.\",2\r\n1576,TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE,\"Traditional Chinese Medicine is a medical system that diagnoses and treats high lipidemia by addressing imbalances in the liver, spleen, and kidney functions, and the accumulation of pathological products like stasis, dampness, and phlegm.\"\"\",1\r\n2218,XANTHOMA,\"Yellowish deposits of fat under the skin, often indicative of high lipid levels, with various types like eyelid xanthoma, tendon xanthoma, and palmar xanthoma>\",1\r\n2294,CIRRHOSIS,\"Cirrhosis is a late-stage liver disease that can be caused by high lipidemia leading to fatty liver and subsequent liver damage.\"\"\",1\r\n2295,PANCREATITIS,\"Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, which can be triggered by high lipidemia.\"\"\",1\r\n2296,GALLSTONES,\"Gallstones are hardened deposits in the gallbladder, often associated with high lipidemia.\"\"\",1\r\n2347,THYROID FUNCTION,\"Thyroid function refers to the activity of the thyroid gland, which can influence lipid metabolism and contribute to high lipidemia when impaired>\",1\r\n2348,FAMILIAL HYPERLIPIDEMIA,Familial hyperlipidemia is a genetic disorder that causes abnormally high levels of lipids in the blood due to inherited mutations>,1\r\n2351,THYROID FUNCTION DECLINE,\"Thyroid function decline is a condition that can cause high lipidemia.\"\"\",1\r\n2368,ALCOHOLISM,Alcoholism is a factor associated with late-stage high lipidemia,1\r\n2439,SOY PROTEIN,\"Soy protein is recommended as part of the dietary management for high lipidemia due to its beneficial effects on lipid levels.\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1797,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,KIDNEY DISEASE,Kidney disease can cause high lipidemia,27\r\n1115,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE,\"Traditional Chinese Medicine provides diagnostic and treatment approaches for high lipidemia, categorizing it under specific syndromes and suggesting dietary and lifestyle adjustments.\",26\r\n1550,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,XANTHOMA,\"High lipidemia can cause xanthomas, which are symptomatic of lipid metabolism disorders\",26\r\n1678,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,CIRRHOSIS,High lipidemia can progress to cirrhosis via fatty liver disease.,26\r\n1679,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,PANCREATITIS,High lipidemia can trigger pancreatitis.,26\r\n1680,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,GALLSTONES,High lipidemia is associated with the formation of gallstones.,26\r\n1789,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,THYROID FUNCTION,Impaired thyroid function can lead to high lipidemia by disrupting lipid metabolism,26\r\n1790,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,FAMILIAL HYPERLIPIDEMIA,Familial hyperlipidemia is a genetic cause of high lipidemia,26\r\n1796,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,THYROID FUNCTION DECLINE,Thyroid function decline can cause high lipidemia,26\r\n1813,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,ALCOHOLISM,Alcoholism is a contributing factor to late-stage high lipidemia,26\r\n1868,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,SOY PROTEIN,Soy protein is recommended in the diet for managing high lipidemia,26\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
