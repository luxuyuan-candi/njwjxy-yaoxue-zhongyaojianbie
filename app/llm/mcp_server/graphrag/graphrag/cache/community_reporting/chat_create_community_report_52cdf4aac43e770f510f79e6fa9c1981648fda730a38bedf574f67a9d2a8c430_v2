This buildup of fat is often associated with disturbances in lipid metabolism, particularly hypertriglyceridemia (elevated serum triglyceride levels) or broader hyperlipidemia (high levels of lipids in the blood). The condition can arise due to various factors, including metabolic dysfunction, obesity, insulin resistance, excessive alcohol consumption, or other underlying health issues.  \n\nWhile fatty liver may initially present without noticeable symptoms, some individuals may experience liver discomfort or mild abdominal pain as the condition progresses. If left unmanaged, it can lead to more severe complications, such as inflammation (steatohepatitis), fibrosis, or cirrhosis. Early detection and lifestyle modifications—such as dietary changes, weight management, and controlling lipid levels—are crucial in preventing further liver damage.  \n\nThe descriptions provided consistently highlight the association between fatty liver and elevated lipid levels, reinforcing the importance of metabolic health in its development and progression.
