Elevated TG levels (≥1.7 mmol/L) are a diagnostic criterion for dyslipidemia and serve as a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). They are also monitored in diabetes management alongside other lipid parameters such as LDL-C and non-HDL-C.  \n\nTG elevation is often linked to an unhealthy lifestyle, including poor diet and lack of exercise, but can be managed through lifestyle modifications such as dietary control and increased physical activity.

IPE is specifically formulated to reduce triglycerides without significantly increasing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, making it a targeted therapeutic option for individuals with persistent hypertriglyceridemia despite statin therapy.  \n\nThe medication is derived from fish oil and contains no docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), distinguishing it from other omega-3-based treatments. Clinical studies have demonstrated that IPE not only lowers triglycerides but also reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in high-risk patients. Its mechanism of action involves modulating lipid metabolism, reducing inflammation, and improving endothelial function.  \n\nIPE is typically prescribed as an adjunct to diet and statin therapy in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia (≥500 mg/dL) or as a secondary prevention measure in those with established cardiovascular disease or diabetes and additional risk factors.
