It is one of the most common chronic diseases, particularly among middle-aged and elderly populations, with high prevalence rates, prolonged duration, and multiple complications that severely threaten human health.  \n\nHypertension is often associated with other metabolic disorders, notably high blood lipids (hyperlipidemia) and high blood sugar (diabetes), collectively referred to as the \"\"three highs\"\" (三高). These conditions synergistically increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, which is accelerated by vascular endothelial damage caused by hypertension. Additionally, hyperlipidemia can both contribute to and exacerbate hypertension, further elevating cardiovascular risks.  \n\nAs a major risk factor for cardiovascular events, hypertension is linked to serious complications such as stroke, heart disease, and kidney damage. Its management is a key focus of clinical guidelines due to its widespread impact on public health. The condition underscores the importance of early detection, lifestyle modifications, and medical interventions to mitigate its long-term consequences.  \n\nIn summary, hypertension is a prevalent, chronic, and multifaceted disease with significant implications for global health, particularly due to its interactions with hyperlipidemia and diabetes, as well as its role in accelerating cardiovascular deterioration.\",20\r\n989,心肌梗死,\"心肌梗死（Myocardial Infarction）是一种严重的心血管疾病，主要由冠状动脉阻塞导致心肌缺血坏死引发。该疾病属于急性心脑血管事件，与高脂血症、动脉硬化以及高血压等危险因素密切相关。研究表明，高脂血症和高血压的联合作用可能进一步增加心肌梗死的发病风险。  \n\n在治疗和预防方面，降脂治疗（如使用洛伐他汀等药物）可有效降低心肌梗死的发病率和死亡率。这一发现强调了血脂管理在心血管疾病防治中的重要性。心肌梗死不仅是一种危及生命的急症，同时也是一种可干预的疾病，通过控制血脂、血压等危险因素，能够显著改善患者的预后。  \n\n综上所述，心肌梗死是一种多因素导致的心脑血管疾病，其发生与动脉硬化、高脂血症及高血压密切相关，而早期干预和降脂治疗可有效降低其发病率和死亡率。\",7\r\n988,高血脂,\"高血脂（Hyperlipidemia）是一种以血液中脂质水平异常升高为特征的代谢性疾病，主要表现为胆固醇、甘油三酯等脂质成分的代谢紊乱。该疾病是动脉粥样硬化（atherosclerosis）的重要危险因素之一，因其可促进血管内脂质斑块的形成与沉积。同时，高血脂还会影响脂质斑块的稳定性，增加斑块破裂和血栓形成的风险，进而可能引发心脑血管事件，如心肌梗死或脑卒中。  \n\n高血脂的病理机制涉及脂质代谢异常，包括低密度脂蛋白（LDL）水平升高或高密度脂蛋白（HDL）水平降低，导致脂质在血管壁积累，形成动脉粥样硬化斑块。此外，脂质代谢紊乱还可能通过炎症反应和氧化应激进一步加剧血管损伤，促进斑块的不稳定性。因此，高血脂不仅与慢性心血管疾病的发展密切相关，还可能直接参与急性血栓性疾病的发病过程。  \n\n综合来看，高血脂是一种需要长期管理的慢性疾病，通过生活方式干预（如饮食调整、运动）和药物治疗（如他汀类药物）可有效控制血脂水平，降低心血管并发症的风险。\",5\r\n1319,乡村医生,乡村医生是经过培训的基层医疗工作者，负责血压监测、用药指导及健康知识推广,1\r\n1324,专科医生,专科医生是基层医疗团队的成员，参与高血压的分级精准管理,1\r\n3008,心血管危险因素,\"Risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, obesity, and family history of early cardiovascular disease\",1\r\n3009,靶器官损害,\"Damage to organs such as the heart, kidneys, and brain caused by hypertension\",1\r\n3010,继发性高血压,\"Hypertension caused by an underlying condition, which requires further evaluation and treatment\",1\r\n3011,难治性高血压,\"Hypertension that is resistant to treatment, requiring specialized care\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n638,高血压,心肌梗死,高血压通过加快动脉硬化进程，增加心肌梗死的风险,27\r\n637,高血压,高血脂,\"Hypertension (高血压) and hyperlipidemia (高血脂) frequently coexist and exhibit a synergistic effect that significantly elevates the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.
