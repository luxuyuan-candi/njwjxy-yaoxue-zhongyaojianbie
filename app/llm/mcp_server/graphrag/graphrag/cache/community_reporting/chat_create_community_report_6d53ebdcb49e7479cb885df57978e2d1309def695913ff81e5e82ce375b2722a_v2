They include common drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, aspirin, and celecoxib. NSAIDs serve as a first-line treatment for acute conditions like migraines, musculoskeletal pain, and gout attacks.  \n\nIn the context of **gout**, NSAIDs are frequently prescribed when colchicine is contraindicated or ineffective. They are particularly useful for managing acute gout flare-ups, with both non-selective COX inhibitors (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) and selective COX-2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) being commonly employed. However, their use requires caution due to potential **gastrointestinal risks** (e.g., ulcers, bleeding) and **cardiovascular risks** (e.g., increased blood pressure, heart attack risk), especially with long-term or high-dose use.  \n\nFor **acute pain management**, NSAIDs are often the preferred choice due to their rapid onset of action and effectiveness in reducing inflammation. Drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen, and diclofenac are frequently used to alleviate pain from conditions such as headaches, sprains, and arthritis.  \n\nIn summary, NSAIDs (非甾体抗炎药) are versatile medications essential for treating acute pain, inflammation, and gout, but their use must be carefully monitored to mitigate adverse effects, particularly in patients with pre-existing gastrointestinal or cardiovascular conditions.\",15\r\n883,肌肉骨骼疼痛,\"Chronic pain condition affecting muscles, bones, joints, tendons or soft tissues, often managed with NSAIDs and physical therapy>\",2\r\n346,胃肠道出血,\"A serious adverse effect linked to NSAID use.\"\"\",1\r\n335,酮洛芬,\"**Ketoprofen (酮洛芬)** is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for managing musculoskeletal pain and acute inflammation. It is available in both topical and oral formulations, with the topical form specifically targeting localized pain relief. When administered orally, it is typically prescribed at a dosage of 50 mg three times daily due to its very short half-life of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 hours. This rapid metabolism necessitates frequent dosing to maintain therapeutic effects.  \n\nAs an NSAID, ketoprofen works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin production and alleviating pain and inflammation. Its short half-life makes it particularly suitable for acute conditions rather than chronic use. The topical formulation offers a targeted approach with potentially fewer systemic side effects compared to oral administration.  \n\nIn summary, ketoprofen is a versatile NSAID with applications in both localized and systemic pain management, characterized by its short duration of action and effectiveness in treating acute inflammatory conditions.\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n293,非甾体抗炎药,IL-1受体拮抗剂,IL-1受体拮抗剂可作为非甾体抗炎药不耐受或有禁忌时的二线治疗药物。,17\r\n668,非甾体抗炎药,肌肉骨骼疼痛,NSAIDs are a primary treatment option for musculoskeletal pain,17\r\n300,非甾体抗炎药,胃肠道出血,NSAIDs may cause gastrointestinal bleeding as a severe adverse effect.,16\r\n667,非甾体抗炎药,酮洛芬,Ketoprofen is a type of NSAID,16\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
