This blockage is often caused by atherosclerosis, a buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which restricts blood supply. Myocardial infarction is a critical complication of coronary heart disease and is frequently associated with elevated lipid levels, including very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a), contributing to its development.  \n\nThe condition is strongly linked to high lipidemia (elevated blood lipids), and lipid-lowering therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction in individuals with coronary heart disease. Additionally, some alternative treatments, such as garlic juice, have been mentioned in relation to managing or mitigating the condition, though further research is needed to confirm efficacy.  \n\nIn summary, myocardial infarction is a life-threatening outcome of coronary artery disease, primarily driven by atherosclerosis and exacerbated by poor lipid profiles.
