It is found in various animal-based foods, with notable examples including duck eggs, chicken eggs, and pig brain, which are often discussed in the context of dietary cholesterol content.  \n\nCholesterol is commonly categorized into \"\"good\"\" (HDL, or high-density lipoprotein) and \"\"bad\"\" (LDL, or low-density lipoprotein) types, each influencing cardiovascular health differently. Optimal levels of these lipoproteins are essential for maintaining health, as imbalances—particularly elevated LDL—can contribute to atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of plaque in arteries. Discussions on cholesterol often emphasize the importance of monitoring and managing these levels to reduce cardiovascular risks.  \n\nIn summary, cholesterol is a biologically significant lipid with seasonal fluctuations, dietary sources in animal products, and a well-documented impact on health through its HDL and LDL subtypes.

These drugs are often used in clinical practice, either as monotherapy or in combination with other treatments, such as statins, when low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets are not achieved. By inhibiting the uptake of cholesterol in the intestines, they help lower overall cholesterol levels in the bloodstream.  \n\nIn addition to their role in managing cholesterol, cholesterol absorption inhibitors can be effectively combined with antihypertensive therapy, making them a versatile option for patients with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. Their mechanism of action complements other lipid-lowering agents, particularly statins, by targeting a different pathway in cholesterol metabolism.  \n\nOverall, cholesterol absorption inhibitors serve as an important therapeutic option for patients requiring additional cholesterol control, especially when statin therapy alone is insufficient. Their ability to integrate with other treatments underscores their utility in comprehensive cardiovascular risk management.\",3\r\n2987,STATINS,\"**Statins** are a class of lipid-lowering drugs primarily used to reduce cholesterol levels by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, a key component in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in the liver. They are considered the first-line treatment for patients with arteriosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, and mixed hyperlipidemia, as well as for high-risk groups to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Statins form the foundation of cholesterol management due to their ability to effectively lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, moderately reduce very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglycerides, and slightly increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels.  \n\nIn addition to their lipid-lowering effects, statins help stabilize atherosclerotic plaques and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Commonly prescribed statins include Lovastatin, Simvastatin, Pravastatin, and Atorvastatin. They are often combined with other lipid-lowering agents for enhanced efficacy in treating mixed hyperlipidemia.  \n\nWhile statins are generally well-tolerated, they may pose risks during pregnancy by interfering with fetal development due to their inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. However, they are not known to have significant interactions with antihypertensive medications, making them suitable for patients with concurrent hypertension.  \n\nOverall, statins play a critical role in cholesterol management and cardiovascular risk reduction, with broad clinical applications in both primary and secondary prevention.\",36\r\n3027,CHOLESTEROL ABSORPTION INHIBITORS,A class of drugs used in combination with statins to lower LDL-C levels,1\r\n3258,LDL,\"Low density lipoprotein, the primary cholesterol-carrying lipoprotein that promotes atherosclerosis>\",4\r\n3259,HDL,\"High density lipoprotein, which helps remove cholesterol from tissues and protects against atherosclerosis>\",4\r\n3893,ELDERLY MEN,\"A patient group (60-75 years) requiring either statin or niacin therapy for lipid control\"\"\",1\r\n3928,ACTIVE HEPATITIS PATIENTS,,1\r\n3425,HIGH BLOOD LIPID LEVELS,\"High blood lipid levels are linked to atherosclerosis, as demonstrated by experiments on animals like rabbits, rats, and monkeys.
