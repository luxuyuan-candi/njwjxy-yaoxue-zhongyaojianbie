These essential fatty acids are naturally found in fatty fish like salmon and tuna, as well as in fish oil supplements. Omega-3s play a significant role in lipid management, contributing to cholesterol reduction and overall cardiovascular health.  \n\nIn addition to their dietary sources, omega-3 fatty acids are also available as prescription-grade medications, such as omega-3 fatty acid ethyl ester 90 soft capsules and polyene ethyl ester soft capsules. These pharmaceutical formulations are specifically designed to lower lipid levels in patients with elevated triglycerides or other lipid disorders.  \n\nWhile omega-3s are primarily known for their cardiovascular benefits, they also serve as vital nutrients for brain function and inflammation regulation. The dual availability of omega-3s—both as natural dietary components and as regulated medical treatments—highlights their versatility in promoting health.  \n\nIn summary, **OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS** encompass a group of essential polyunsaturated fats with applications in both nutrition and medicine. They are derived from fish and fish oil, support cholesterol management, and are formulated into prescription drugs for targeted lipid-lowering therapy.\",7\r\n3028,FIBRATES,\"**FIBRATES** are a class of drugs primarily used to lower triglyceride levels in the blood. This group includes medications such as fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, and clofibrate. In addition to their primary role in reducing triglycerides, fibrates also modestly increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, often referred to as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol.  \n\nThe mechanism of action of fibrates involves multiple pathways. They inhibit adenylate cyclase, reduce the release of fatty acids, and enhance the activity of lipoprotein lipase, an enzyme that breaks down very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglycerides. These actions collectively lead to reductions in VLDL, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and total cholesterol levels.  \n\nWhile fibrates are most effective in managing hypertriglyceridemia, their impact on HDL cholesterol provides additional cardiovascular benefits. However, their influence on LDL cholesterol is less pronounced compared to other lipid-lowering agents like statins. Overall, fibrates are a well-established therapeutic option for patients with elevated triglyceride levels and mixed dyslipidemia.\",10\r\n4553,CIPROFIBRATE,\"Ciprofibrate is a fibrate drug administered orally, 0.1 g per dose, once daily.\"\"\",1\r\n3906,FENOFIBRATE,\"**Fenofibrate** is a fibrate-class lipid-lowering drug administered orally in tablet form, typically at a dosage of 0.1 g per dose, three times daily. It is primarily used to reduce elevated triglyceride levels in the blood and is often combined with statins or ω-3 fatty acids for the treatment of mixed hyperlipidemia. As a fibrate drug, Fenofibrate plays a significant role in managing lipid disorders by modulating lipid metabolism. The descriptions collectively highlight its therapeutic application, dosage form, and common adjunct therapies, providing a comprehensive overview of its clinical use.  \n\nNo contradictions were found in the provided descriptions; instead, they complement one another to present a unified summary of Fenofibrate's pharmacological properties and indications.\",5\r\n3907,BEZAFIBRATE,\"**BEZAFIBRATE**  \n\nBezafibrate is a fibrate-class lipid-lowering drug administered orally for the management of dyslipidemia. It is typically prescribed in doses of 0.3 or 0.6 grams per administration, taken twice daily. As a fibrate, it primarily functions to reduce elevated lipid levels, including triglycerides and cholesterol, thereby aiding in cardiovascular risk management. The drug is widely recognized for its role in improving lipid profiles and is commonly used in clinical practice.  \n\nThe descriptions confirm that bezafibrate belongs to the fibrate class of drugs and is utilized for its lipid-modulating effects. While one description specifies its dosage regimen (0.3 or 0.6 g twice daily), the other broadly categorizes it as a lipid-lowering agent. There are no contradictions between the provided descriptions; rather, they complement each other by detailing both its classification and dosing information.  \n\nIn summary, bezafibrate is an oral fibrate medication used to treat lipid disorders, with a standard dosing protocol of 0.3 or 0.6 grams twice daily. Its primary therapeutic action involves lowering triglycerides and cholesterol levels to mitigate cardiovascular risks.\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2551,OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS,STATINS,Sometimes combined to address both LDL-C and TG levels,43\r\n2549,FIBRATES,OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS,Combination used for severe hypertriglyceridemia,17\r\n4805,FIBRATES,CIPROFIBRATE,Ciprofibrate is a type of fibrate,11\r\n3944,FENOFIBRATE,FIBRATE CLASS,Fenofibrate belongs to the fibrate class of lipid-lowering drugs,9\r\n3946,BEZAFIBRATE,FIBRATE CLASS,Bezafibrate belongs to the fibrate class of lipid-lowering drugs,6\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
