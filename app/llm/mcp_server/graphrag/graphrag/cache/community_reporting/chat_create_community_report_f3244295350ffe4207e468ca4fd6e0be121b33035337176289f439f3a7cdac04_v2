Its scope encompasses a wide range of topics, including mental health, antidepressant drug usage, and blood lipid management. Notably, the December 2021 issue (Volume 20, Issue 12) featured research on general practice. In 2024, the journal published two significant consensus documents: the **Chinese expert consensus on adult blood lipid management in communities** and the **Chinese expert consensus on mixed hyperlipidemia**, highlighting its role in disseminating authoritative clinical guidance. The journal serves as a key resource for healthcare professionals in the field of general practice, covering both research and practical guidelines.\",13\n132,AMITRIPTYLINE,\"**AMITRIPTYLINE** is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) primarily used for treating anxiety and depression. It is known to have significant side effects, which may include arrhythmia and dry mouth, among others. The medication belongs to a class of drugs with well-documented adverse effects, though its efficacy in managing mood disorders remains a key therapeutic application. The descriptions collectively emphasize its role as a TCA while acknowledging its potential for notable side effects.\",3\n135,MAPROTILINE,\"**MAPROTILINE** is a tetracyclic antidepressant (TeCA) used primarily for the treatment of depression, with pharmacological effects similar to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). It is classified as a category B antidepressant, indicating that it is considered safer for use during pregnancy compared to other antidepressants, though caution and medical supervision are still advised. MAPROTILINE's mechanism of action involves modulating neurotransmitter levels in the brain, contributing to its efficacy in managing depressive symptoms. Overall, it serves as a therapeutic option for depression with a relatively favorable safety profile in specific patient populations, such as pregnant individuals.\",1\n136,FLUPENTIXOL/MELITRACEN,\"A compound preparation used to control anxiety and improve sleep, with side effects like dry mouth and constipation\"\"\",1\n137,ST.
