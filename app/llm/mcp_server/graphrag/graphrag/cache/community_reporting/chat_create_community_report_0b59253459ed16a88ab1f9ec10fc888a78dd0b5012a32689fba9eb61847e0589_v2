It is effective in alleviating symptoms like fever, sore throat, and cough. The medicine works by dispelling wind, ventilating the lungs, clearing heat, and detoxifying the body. It is specifically designed for fever caused by external seasonal pathogens, particularly in cases where there is mild or no aversion to cold.  \n\nCombining its antiviral and symptom-relieving properties, **金花清感颗粒** serves as a therapeutic option for respiratory infections with heat-related symptoms. Its dual action—targeting both the underlying pathogens and the resulting discomfort—makes it a versatile treatment in traditional Chinese medicine.
