It is involved in the breakdown and processing of numerous pharmaceutical compounds, including certain beta-blockers, highlighting its importance in pharmacokinetics and drug efficacy. Additionally, CYP2D6 is known to be influenced by inhibitors, which can alter its activity and impact drug metabolism. This enzyme's function is essential for understanding drug interactions and individual variability in medication response. Overall, CYP2D6 serves as a key player in drug metabolism, with implications for both therapeutic outcomes and adverse effects.\",4\r\n3529,艾司西酞普兰,艾司西酞普兰是一种SSRIs类抗抑郁药，常用剂量为10~20mg/d，疗效和耐受性相对更为平衡，不良反应与西酞普兰类似>,5\r\n3317,氟西汀,\"氟西汀（Fluoxetine）是一种选择性血清素再摄取抑制剂（SSRI）类抗抑郁药物，主要通过抑制中枢神经系统对血清素的再摄取发挥作用。其代谢途径涉及肝酶CYP2D6，但氟西汀本身也是CYP2D6的强效抑制剂。这一特性导致其能够显著减慢依赖CYP2D6代谢的其他药物的清除速率，例如美托洛尔（一种β受体阻滞剂）和右美沙芬（一种镇咳药）。  \n\n氟西汀通过抑制CYP2D6酶活性，可能延长合用药物的作用时间或增加其血药浓度，从而引发潜在的药物相互作用或不良反应。因此，在联合使用氟西汀与依赖CYP2D6代谢的药物时，需密切监测患者反应并调整剂量以避免毒性风险。  \n\n综上，氟西汀既是CYP2D6的代谢底物，也是其抑制剂，具有双重药代动力学特性，这一特点在临床用药中需予以重视。\",10\r\n3316,美托洛尔,\"**美托洛尔（Metoprolol）** 是一种β受体阻滞剂（beta-blocker），主要用于治疗高血压、心绞痛和心律失常等心血管疾病。其药效可能受到其他药物的影响，尤其是通过细胞色素P450酶CYP2D6代谢途径的相互作用。  \n\n美托洛尔与某些药物合用时需特别注意：  \n1. **CYP2D6抑制剂（如氟西汀、帕罗西汀）**：这些药物可能抑制美托洛尔的代谢，导致其血药浓度升高，从而增强药效或增加不良反应风险。  \n2. **普罗帕酮**：与美托洛尔联用可能进一步抑制CYP2D6活性，加剧美托洛尔的血药浓度升高，并增加心动过缓或低血压等不良反应的风险。  \n3. **维拉帕米**：作为钙通道阻滞剂，与美托洛尔合用时可能协同抑制心脏传导系统，加重心动过缓或低血压等副作用。  \n\n综上，美托洛尔的药效和安全性易受合并用药影响，尤其是与CYP2D6抑制剂、普罗帕酮或维拉帕米联用时需密切监测。临床使用时应根据患者情况调整剂量，以避免潜在的不良反应。\",4\r\n3360,亚甲蓝,亚甲蓝是一种药物，属于非选择性MAOI类,2\r\n3361,他莫昔芬,他莫昔芬是一种抗肿瘤药，经 CYP2D6 代谢为重要的活性代谢物 endoxifen,1\r\n3345,司来吉兰,\"Selegiline, a Parkinson's disease medication that can cause severe interactions with certain antidepressants>\",4\r\n3346,西酞普兰,\"**西酞普兰（Citalopram）** 是一种选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（SSRIs）类抗抑郁药，主要用于治疗抑郁症，尤其适用于伴有焦虑症状的患者。其常用剂量范围为20~40毫克/天（mg/d）。常见的不良反应包括恶心、呕吐、消化不良等胃肠道症状。  \n\n需要注意的是，西酞普兰与其他影响血清素水平的药物（如司来吉兰（selegiline））联用时，可能增加血清素综合征的风险。血清素综合征是一种严重的药物不良反应，表现为高热、意识模糊、震颤等症状，需谨慎用药并密切监测。  \n\n综上，西酞普兰是一种有效的抗抑郁药，但使用时需注意剂量控制和药物相互作用，以避免不良反应的发生。\",6\r\n3347,舍曲林,\"舍曲林（Sertraline）是一种选择性5-羟色胺再摄取抑制剂（SSRIs）类抗抑郁药，其常用剂量范围为50~200mg/天。该药物以疗效和耐受性的平衡性著称，在改善抑郁症状的同时，对认知功能也有一定的正向作用。然而，舍曲林与某些药物（如司来吉兰/selegiline）联用时可能引发严重不良反应，需谨慎避免药物相互作用。  \n\n舍曲林作为SSRIs的代表性药物，其机制是通过增加突触间隙的5-羟色胺浓度来发挥抗抑郁效果。临床研究表明，它在抑郁障碍治疗中表现出较好的安全性和有效性，但与其他单胺氧化酶抑制剂（如司来吉兰）合用时，可能增加5-羟色胺综合征的风险，因此联合用药前需严格评估禁忌症。总体而言，舍曲林在抑郁症治疗中具有重要地位，但需遵循个体化用药原则并注意潜在的药物相互作用。\",6\r\n3362,氟伏沙明,氟伏沙明是一种药物，强烈抑制 CYP1A2，显著减慢茶碱的代谢,6\r\n3363,茶碱,茶碱是一种药物，与氟伏沙明合用时总清除率降低，t1/2延长,2\r\n3318,普罗帕酮,\"普罗帕酮是一种Ⅰc类抗心律失常药物，主要用于治疗心律失常。其药理作用包括抑制心脏钠通道，从而减缓心肌细胞的电信号传导。此外，普罗帕酮还表现出对肝脏细胞色素P450酶系统（尤其是CYP2D6酶）的抑制作用，这一特性可能导致与其他药物的相互作用。  \n\n当与帕罗西汀（一种抗抑郁药）合用时，普罗帕酮可能抑制帕罗西汀的代谢，导致其血药浓度升高，增加不良反应的风险。类似地，普罗帕酮与美托洛尔（一种β受体阻滞剂）合用时，会通过抑制CYP2D6酶而减慢美托洛尔的代谢，从而提高其血药浓度，可能增强美托洛尔的药理作用或副作用。  \n\n综合来看，普罗帕酮不仅具有抗心律失常的作用，还可能通过抑制CYP2D6酶影响其他药物的代谢，因此在临床使用中需注意潜在的药物相互作用，必要时调整剂量或监测血药浓度以避免不良反应。\",2\r\n1062,右美沙芬,\"右美沙芬是一种镇咳药，效果次于苯丙哌林。\"\"\",2\r\n1064,祛痰药,\"祛痰药是一类药物，与镇咳药联合使用但不同时使用，以避免痰液黏稠不易咳出。\"\"\",3\r\n3300,PROPRANOLOL,Propranolol is a lipophilic beta-blocker metabolized by CYP2D6,1\r\n1061,苯丙哌林,\"苯丙哌林是一种镇咳药，被认为是效果最好的镇咳药。\"\"\",1\r\n1063,福尔可定,\"福尔可定是一种镇咳药，效果次于右美沙芬。\"\"\",1\r\n3359,利奈唑胺,利奈唑胺是一种抗生素，属于MAOI类,3\r\n3373,单胺类药物,,1\r\n3374,5-羟色胺能药物,,1\r\n878,ESMOLOL,\"Esmolol is a beta-blocker administered intravenously for hypertensive emergencies, with effects like hypotension and nausea>\",1\r\n879,METOPROLOL,\"Metoprolol is a beta-blocker used for perioperative hypertension, with side effects including hypotension, heart failure, and bronchospasm>\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2755,帕罗西汀,CYP2D6,Paroxetine is metabolized by CYP2D6 and also inhibits it,16\r\n2938,艾司西酞普兰,氟西汀,艾司西酞普兰和氟西汀均为SSRIs类抗抑郁药，且不良反应类似,15\r\n2692,美托洛尔,氟西汀,氟西汀抑制CYP2D6，减慢美托洛尔的代谢,14\r\n2753,氟西汀,CYP2D6,Fluoxetine is metabolized by CYP2D6 and also inhibits it,14\r\n2766,帕罗西汀,亚甲蓝,帕罗西汀与亚甲蓝合用可能导致5-羟色胺综合征,14\r\n2768,帕罗西汀,他莫昔芬,帕罗西汀通过抑制 CYP2D6 减慢他莫昔芬的代谢活性而影响其抗肿瘤作用,13\r\n2745,司来吉兰,西酞普兰,Combining selegiline with citalopram can lead to serotonin syndrome due to pharmacodynamic interactions,10\r\n2747,司来吉兰,舍曲林,\"Combining selegiline with sertraline can cause severe reactions like hypertension, coma, and ataxia\",10\r\n2772,西酞普兰,司来吉兰,MAOI 能增强5-羟色胺能的作用，与西酞普兰合用时可能导致5-羟色胺综合征,10\r\n2771,氟伏沙明,茶碱,氟伏沙明强烈抑制 CYP1A2，显著减慢茶碱的代谢,8\r\n2693,美托洛尔,普罗帕酮,\"美托洛尔和普罗帕酮是两种心血管药物，它们之间存在显著的药物相互作用。普罗帕酮通过抑制肝脏中的CYP2D6酶，显著减慢美托洛尔的代谢过程。这种抑制作用不仅延长了美托洛尔在体内的清除时间，还导致其血药浓度升高，从而可能增强美托洛尔的药理效应或不良反应风险。因此，当这两种药物联合使用时，需密切监测患者的临床反应，必要时调整美托洛尔的剂量以避免潜在毒性。  \n\n（注：两段描述内容一致，无矛盾，故合并为单一结论。）\",6\r\n709,右美沙芬,祛痰药,右美沙芬等镇咳药需要联合祛痰药使用，但不同时使用,5\r\n2668,CYP2D6,PROPRANOLOL,Propranolol is metabolized by CYP2D6,5\r\n708,苯丙哌林,祛痰药,苯丙哌林等镇咳药需要联合祛痰药使用，但不同时使用,4\r\n710,福尔可定,祛痰药,福尔可定等镇咳药需要联合祛痰药使用，但不同时使用,4\r\n2777,利奈唑胺,单胺类药物,利奈唑胺与单胺类药物合用可能导致5-羟色胺综合征,4\r\n2778,利奈唑胺,5-羟色胺能药物,利奈唑胺与5-羟色胺能药物合用可能导致5-羟色胺综合征,4\r\n565,ESMOLOL,METOPROLOL,\"Both are beta-blockers used for hypertension, with similar mechanisms but different durations of action\",3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
