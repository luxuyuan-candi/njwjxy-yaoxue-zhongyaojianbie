It is classified as a crystal-related arthropathy, directly associated with purine metabolism disorders and/or impaired uric acid excretion.  \n\nClinically, gout manifests as sudden, severe joint inflammation, typically affecting the lower extremities, including the first metatarsophalangeal joint (big toe), instep, heel, ankle, and knee. Acute episodes involve redness, swelling, and intense pain, usually resolving within days to two weeks. Attacks are frequently triggered by factors such as alcohol consumption, high-purine diets (e.g., red meat, seafood), cold exposure, or strenuous exercise. Over time, untreated gout may lead to chronic joint damage, with symptoms becoming less typical and involving multiple joints. Severe cases can present with systemic symptoms like fever, chills, fatigue, and palpitations.  \n\nAs a systemic metabolic disease, gout is often accompanied by comorbidities, including dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides and total cholesterol), hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease. It may also contribute to kidney dysfunction due to urate crystal deposition or uric acid nephropathy.  \n\nManagement focuses on controlling hyperuricemia through urate-lowering therapy (e.g., allopurinol, febuxostat) and lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes and reduced alcohol intake. Gout is a global health concern, with varying prevalence across regions. Early diagnosis and long-term treatment are crucial to prevent recurrent attacks and systemic complications.  \n\n*Note: Contradictions were resolved by integrating overlapping details (e.g., metabolic and joint disease aspects) and prioritizing clinically established associations (e.g., hyperuricemia as the primary driver).*\",10\r\n187,高尿酸血症,\"高尿酸血症是痛风的主要病因，由嘌呤代谢紊乱和/或尿酸排泄减少所致。2018年我国慢性病及危险因素监测数据显示，我国成人居民高尿酸血症患病率达14.0%，男性为24.5%，女性为3.6%，青年男性（18~29岁）患病率达32.3%。\"\"\",1\r\n188,欧洲,\"欧洲痛风患病率为0.9%~2.5%。\"\"\",1\r\n191,急性尿酸性肾病,\"急性尿酸性肾病是由于血和尿中尿酸浓度急剧上升，大量尿酸沉积并堵塞于肾小管、集合管等处，导致急性尿路梗阻。临床表现为急性少尿、无尿，急性肾衰竭，尿中可见大量尿酸。\"\"\",1\r\n192,慢性痛风石病变期,\"慢性痛风石病变期是长期血尿酸显著升高未受控制的结果，表现为皮下痛风石和慢性痛风石关节炎。皮下痛风石常见的发生部位为耳廓、反复发作关节的周围及鹰嘴、跟腱、髌骨滑囊等处，外观为皮下隆起的大小不一的黄白色赘生物，破溃后排出白色粉状或糊状物，不易愈合。慢性痛风石关节炎为关节内沉积大量MSU晶体导致痛风石形成，表现为持续关节肿痛、压痛、畸形和功能障碍，可致关节骨质的破坏、关节周围组织纤维化、继发退行性变等。\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n124,痛风,高尿酸血症,痛风与高尿酸血症直接相关，高尿酸血症是痛风的主要病因。,11\r\n125,痛风,欧洲,欧洲痛风患病率为0.9%~2.5%。,11\r\n128,痛风,急性尿酸性肾病,痛风患者可能因尿酸浓度急剧上升导致急性尿酸性肾病,11\r\n129,痛风,慢性痛风石病变期,长期未受控制的痛风可能导致慢性痛风石病变期,11\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
