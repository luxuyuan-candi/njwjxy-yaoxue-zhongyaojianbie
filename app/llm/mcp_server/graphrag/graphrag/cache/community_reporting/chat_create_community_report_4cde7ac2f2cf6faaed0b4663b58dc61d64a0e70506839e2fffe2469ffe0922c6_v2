It is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis, and accelerates arterial hardening by damaging vascular endothelium, thereby increasing the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events.  \n\nHypertension is closely linked to hyperlipidemia (高脂血症), with the two often coexisting as part of the \"\"three highs\"\" (alongside high blood sugar), collectively threatening the health of individuals, particularly diabetic patients. It is both a risk factor for and a potential consequence of hyperlipidemia, forming a bidirectional relationship. Specific treatment principles exist for managing hypertension accompanied by hyperlipidemia, as hypertensive patients are considered a high-risk group for developing hyperlipidemia.  \n\nThe condition is prevalent among middle-aged and elderly populations, marked by high incidence rates, prolonged duration, and multiple complications, making it a significant public health concern. Additionally, hypertension can arise as an adverse effect of glucocorticoid use.  \n\nIn summary, hypertension is a multifaceted cardiovascular disease with systemic implications, frequently associated with metabolic disorders like hyperlipidemia and diabetes. Its management requires addressing interrelated risk factors to mitigate long-term health consequences.\",47\r\n1996,左心室肥厚,\"左心室肥厚（Left Ventricular Hypertrophy, LVH）是一种心脏结构异常，表现为左心室壁增厚，通常由长期压力或容量负荷过重引起。根据描述，左心室肥厚可通过心电图（ECG）或超声心动图（echocardiographic criteria）诊断，并被确认为动脉粥样硬化性心血管疾病（ASCVD）的风险标志之一。此外，左心室肥厚也可能是高血压合并血脂异常所导致的心脏并发症，提示其与代谢紊乱及心血管系统慢性损伤密切相关。  \n\n综合来看，左心室肥厚既是心血管疾病风险的独立预测因子，又与高血压和血脂异常等代谢性疾病相互作用，可能进一步加剧心脏功能障碍。其诊断和监测对评估患者ASCVD风险及制定干预策略具有重要意义。\",3\r\n1168,颈动脉内膜中层厚度,\"**颈动脉内膜中层厚度 (Carotid Intima-Media Thickness, CIMT)** is a clinical measurement used to assess cardiovascular risk.

A CIMT value of **≥0.9 mm** or the presence of plaque in the carotid artery is considered an indicator of increased risk for **atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)**. This measurement serves as a non-invasive tool to identify early signs of arterial thickening and atherosclerosis, aiding in the early detection and management of cardiovascular conditions.  \n\nThe assessment of CIMT is widely utilized in preventive cardiology to stratify patients' risk levels, guiding interventions such as lifestyle modifications or medical therapies to mitigate future cardiovascular events.\",2\r\n1189,Β-受体阻滞剂,\"Beta-Blockers, a class of drugs that reduce blood pressure by blocking the effects of adrenaline\"\"\",2\r\n1431,脑血管事件,脑血管事件的发生显著提高了患者的生活质量和预期寿命,2\r\n4439,心血管危险因素,\"Risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, obesity, and family history of early cardiovascular disease\",1\r\n4441,继发性高血压,\"Hypertension caused by an underlying condition, which requires further evaluation and treatment\",1\r\n4442,微量白蛋白尿,\"Small amounts of albumin in the urine, an early sign of kidney damage related to hypertension\",1\r\n4443,血肌酐浓度轻度升高,\"Mild elevation of serum creatinine, indicating potential kidney dysfunction\",1\r\n4444,脑血管疾病,\"Cerebrovascular diseases including ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and TIA, associated with hypertension\",1\r\n4445,心脏疾病,\"Cardiac conditions such as angina, myocardial infarction, chronic heart failure, and atrial fibrillation linked to hypertension\",1\r\n4446,外周血管疾病,Peripheral vascular diseases that may be caused or exacerbated by hypertension,1\r\n4447,肾脏疾病,\"Kidney diseases including significant creatinine elevation or reduced eGFR, related to hypertension\",1\r\n4448,重度高血压性视网膜病变,\"Severe hypertensive retinopathy characterized by hemorrhages, exudates, or papilledema\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1637,高血压,左心室肥厚,\"Hypertension (高血压) is a significant medical condition that often leads to left ventricular hypertrophy (左心室肥厚), a thickening of the heart's left ventricle wall.
