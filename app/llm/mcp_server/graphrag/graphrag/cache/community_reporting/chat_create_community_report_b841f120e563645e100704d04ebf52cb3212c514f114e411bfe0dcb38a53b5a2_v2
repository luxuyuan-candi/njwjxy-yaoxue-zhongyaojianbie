This class includes well-known drugs such as **Mevacor (美降之, Lovastatin)**, **Zocor (舒降之, Simvastatin)**, **Pravachol (普拉固, Pravastatin)**, **Lescol (来适可, Fluvastatin)**, and **Lipitor (力普妥, Atorvastatin)**. Statins work by inhibiting an enzyme involved in cholesterol production in the liver, thereby reducing overall cholesterol levels and decreasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.  \n\nThese medications are widely prescribed for managing hyperlipidemia (elevated blood lipids) and preventing complications such as atherosclerosis, heart attacks, and strokes. While their primary function is to lower LDL cholesterol, some statins may also have modest effects on increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and reducing triglycerides.  \n\nThe descriptions provided highlight both the brand names (e.g., Mevacor, Lipitor) and generic names (e.g., Lovastatin, Atorvastatin) of these drugs, emphasizing their widespread use and recognition in clinical practice. There are no contradictions between the descriptions; rather, they complement each other by providing additional details on the drug class, its therapeutic purpose, and specific examples.  \n\nIn summary, **Statin Drugs** are a critical pharmacological tool for managing cholesterol levels and mitigating cardiovascular risks, with a well-established roster of medications under both brand and generic names. Their efficacy and safety profile have made them a cornerstone in the treatment of lipid disorders.\",9\r\n3505,FLUVASTATIN,\"**Fluvastatin** is a moderate-intensity statin medication primarily used to treat high cholesterol. As a member of the statin drug class, it works by inhibiting an enzyme involved in cholesterol production, thereby helping to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Fluvastatin is prescribed to manage elevated cholesterol levels, including in patients with hyperlipidemia or those at risk for atherosclerosis. Its moderate-intensity classification indicates it is typically used when a balanced approach to cholesterol management is required, offering efficacy with a generally favorable safety profile. Fluvastatin is available in oral formulations, such as tablets or capsules, and is often part of a broader treatment plan that includes lifestyle modifications like diet and exercise.\",2\r\n3502,BRITISH HYPERTENSION SOCIETY,The British Hypertension Society recommends statin drugs as primary and secondary prevention for cardiovascular diseases,1\r\n3503,HMG-COA,An enzyme targeted by statin drugs to reduce cholesterol production,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3355,STATIN DRUGS,FLUVASTATIN,Fluvastatin belongs to the statin class of drugs,11\r\n3350,STATIN DRUGS,BRITISH HYPERTENSION SOCIETY,The British Hypertension Society recommends statin drugs for cardiovascular disease prevention,10\r\n3351,STATIN DRUGS,HMG-COA,Statins work by inhibiting the HMG-CoA enzyme to reduce cholesterol production,10\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
