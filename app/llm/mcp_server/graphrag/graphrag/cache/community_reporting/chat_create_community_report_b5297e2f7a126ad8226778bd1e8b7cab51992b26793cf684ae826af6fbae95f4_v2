It is primarily used to reduce elevated triglyceride levels in the blood and is often prescribed in combination with statins or Ï‰-3 fatty acids for the treatment of mixed hyperlipidemia. By targeting lipid metabolism, fenofibrate helps manage dyslipidemia and supports cardiovascular health. Its dual role as a standalone therapy and a complementary treatment alongside other lipid-lowering agents makes it a versatile option for patients with hypertriglyceridemia or mixed lipid disorders. The drug's oral tablet formulation ensures ease of administration, while its dosing regimen is designed to maintain therapeutic efficacy.\",3\r\n2572,FIBRATES,\"**Fibrates** are a class of drugs primarily used to lower triglyceride levels and, to a lesser extent, increase HDL (\"\"good\"\") cholesterol levels. This group includes medications such as **fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, and clofibrate**. Fibrates work through multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of adenylate cyclase, reduction of fatty acid release, and enhancement of lipoprotein lipase activity. These actions collectively lead to decreased levels of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and total cholesterol.  \n\nWhile their primary therapeutic effect is on triglycerides, fibrates also exhibit modest benefits in raising HDL cholesterol. Their pharmacological properties make them particularly useful in managing hypertriglyceridemia and mixed dyslipidemia. The class encompasses several specific drugs, each with slight variations in efficacy and mechanism, but all share the common goal of improving lipid profiles.  \n\nIn summary, fibrates are a well-established class of lipid-modifying agents with a focus on triglyceride reduction, supported by additional effects on other lipid parameters, including HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.\",7\r\n2573,PROBUCOL,\"Probucol, also known as 'Bifenabid,' is a highly lipophilic compound with lipid-regulating properties>\",1\r\n3090,GEMFIBROZIL,\"Gemfibrozil is a fibrate drug administered orally in capsule form, 0.2 or 0.25 g per dose, once daily.\"\"\",1\r\n3091,BEZAFIBRATE,\"Bezafibrate is a fibrate drug administered orally, 0.3 or 0.6 g per dose, twice daily.\"\"\",1\r\n3092,CIPROFIBRATE,\"Ciprofibrate is a fibrate drug administered orally, 0.1 g per dose, once daily.\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2499,FENOFIBRATE,STATINS,Statins and fenofibrate are combined to manage mixed hyperlipidemia when triglyceride levels are elevated,17\r\n1978,FIBRATES,PROBUCOL,\"Probucol and fibrates are both lipid-regulating agents, though their mechanisms differ\",8\r\n2483,FIBRATES,GEMFIBROZIL,Gemfibrozil is a type of fibrate,8\r\n2484,FIBRATES,BEZAFIBRATE,Bezafibrate is a type of fibrate,8\r\n2485,FIBRATES,CIPROFIBRATE,Ciprofibrate is a type of fibrate,8\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
