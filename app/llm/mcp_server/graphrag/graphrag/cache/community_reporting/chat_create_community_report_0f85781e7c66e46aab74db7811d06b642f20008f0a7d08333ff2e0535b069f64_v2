It serves as a leading authority in setting guidelines for disease prevention, treatment, and public health policies worldwide. The WHO conducts extensive research on a wide range of health conditions, including mental health issues such as depression, to provide evidence-based recommendations and support to member states.  \n\nAs a specialized agency of the United Nations, the WHO plays a pivotal role in coordinating international health efforts, responding to health emergencies, and advancing universal healthcare access. Its work encompasses disease surveillance, health education, and the development of global health standards to improve outcomes for populations across the globe. By bridging scientific research with practical health interventions, the WHO strives to address both communicable and non-communicable diseases, ensuring equitable health solutions for all.\",2\r\n186,痛风,\"**Gout (痛风)** is a metabolic and inflammatory joint disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of arthritis, often linked to hyperuricemia (elevated blood uric acid levels) and the deposition of urate crystals in joints and surrounding tissues. It is classified as a crystal-related arthropathy, directly associated with purine metabolism disorders and/or impaired uric acid excretion.  \n\nClinically, gout manifests as sudden, severe joint inflammation, typically affecting the lower extremities, including the first metatarsophalangeal joint (big toe), instep, heel, ankle, and knee. Acute episodes involve redness, swelling, and intense pain, usually resolving within days to two weeks. Attacks are frequently triggered by factors such as alcohol consumption, high-purine diets (e.g., red meat, seafood), cold exposure, or strenuous exercise. Over time, untreated gout may lead to chronic joint damage, with symptoms becoming less typical and involving multiple joints. Severe cases can present with systemic symptoms like fever, chills, fatigue, and palpitations.  \n\nAs a systemic metabolic disease, gout is often accompanied by comorbidities, including dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides and total cholesterol), hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease. It may also contribute to kidney dysfunction due to urate crystal deposition or uric acid nephropathy.  \n\nManagement focuses on controlling hyperuricemia through urate-lowering therapy (e.g., allopurinol, febuxostat) and lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes and reduced alcohol intake. Gout is a global health concern, with varying prevalence across regions. Early diagnosis and long-term treatment are crucial to prevent recurrent attacks and systemic complications.  \n\n*Note: Contradictions were resolved by integrating overlapping details (e.g., metabolic and joint disease aspects) and prioritizing clinically established associations (e.g., hyperuricemia as the primary driver).*\",10\r\n189,美国,\"**Summary of Data on the United States (美国):**  \n\nThe **United States (美国)** is a country with significant health-related trends and challenges, as evidenced by multiple studies and reports. Research from the International Consortium of Psychiatric Epidemiology (ICPE) indicates that the U.S. has a high lifetime prevalence of depression, highlighting mental health as a critical public health concern. Additionally, the country's tiered healthcare system has been studied for its implications, particularly in comparison to China's healthcare reforms, suggesting its influence on global healthcare policy discussions.  \n\nThe U.S. has also been associated with increased cardiovascular disease incidence among Inuit (Eskimo) populations following migration, pointing to potential lifestyle or environmental factors affecting health outcomes. Furthermore, the prevalence of gout has risen steadily, increasing from 2.64% (1988–1994) to 3.76% (2007–2010), possibly linked to dietary changes or metabolic risk factors.  \n\nContradictory findings exist regarding cholesterol levels and mortality. Some U.S. medical reports suggest that low cholesterol levels may correlate with higher mortality risks, particularly in elderly populations. Conversely, American scientists have found that elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels may protect against coronary heart disease, underscoring the complexity of lipid metabolism in health outcomes.  \n\nIn summary, the U.S. faces diverse health challenges, including mental health disparities, healthcare system complexities, rising metabolic disorders, and conflicting evidence on cardiovascular risk factors. These findings reflect the multifaceted nature of public health in the country.

Research and guidelines on various health issues, including mental health and chronic diseases, are developed within the country.  \n\nOne notable area of study is the prevalence of gout, which affects approximately 1%–3% of the population and has been increasing annually. The condition is more common in men, while women typically develop it after menopause. Data from the National Rheumatology Data Center's network registration and follow-up studies indicate a male-to-female ratio of 15:1, with an average age of onset at 48.28 years. Additionally, the disease is gradually becoming more prevalent among younger individuals.  \n\nThese findings highlight China's active role in public health research, addressing both mental health concerns like depression and chronic conditions such as gout, while also tracking demographic trends in disease prevalence.\",4\r\n187,高尿酸血症,\"高尿酸血症是痛风的主要病因，由嘌呤代谢紊乱和/或尿酸排泄减少所致。2018年我国慢性病及危险因素监测数据显示，我国成人居民高尿酸血症患病率达14.0%，男性为24.5%，女性为3.6%，青年男性（18~29岁）患病率达32.3%。\"\"\",1\r\n188,欧洲,\"欧洲痛风患病率为0.9%~2.5%。\"\"\",1\r\n191,急性尿酸性肾病,\"急性尿酸性肾病是由于血和尿中尿酸浓度急剧上升，大量尿酸沉积并堵塞于肾小管、集合管等处，导致急性尿路梗阻。临床表现为急性少尿、无尿，急性肾衰竭，尿中可见大量尿酸。\"\"\",1\r\n192,慢性痛风石病变期,\"慢性痛风石病变期是长期血尿酸显著升高未受控制的结果，表现为皮下痛风石和慢性痛风石关节炎。皮下痛风石常见的发生部位为耳廓、反复发作关节的周围及鹰嘴、跟腱、髌骨滑囊等处，外观为皮下隆起的大小不一的黄白色赘生物，破溃后排出白色粉状或糊状物，不易愈合。慢性痛风石关节炎为关节内沉积大量MSU晶体导致痛风石形成，表现为持续关节肿痛、压痛、畸形和功能障碍，可致关节骨质的破坏、关节周围组织纤维化、继发退行性变等。\"\"\",1\r\n212,别嘌醇,\"别嘌醇是一种用于治疗高尿酸血症的药物，其主要作用机制是通过抑制黄嘌呤氧化酶来减少尿酸的形成，从而有效降低血液中的尿酸水平。作为抑制尿酸合成的药物，别嘌醇在临床中常用于降尿酸治疗，尤其适用于痛风等由高尿酸血症引起的疾病。  \n\n使用别嘌醇时需根据患者的肾功能调整剂量，以确保用药的安全性和有效性。该药物通过精准调控尿酸生成，帮助患者维持正常的尿酸代谢，减少因尿酸沉积引发的并发症。  \n\n综上所述，别嘌醇是一种高效、针对性强的降尿酸药物，适用于高尿酸血症及相关疾病的治疗，但需在医生指导下合理使用，特别是肾功能不全的患者需谨慎调整剂量。\",5\r\n213,非布司他,\"非布司他是一种抑制尿酸合成的药物，用于降尿酸治疗，对轻中度肾功能不全者无需调整剂量\"\"\",5\r\n211,降尿酸治疗,\"降尿酸治疗是用于痛风患者的治疗方法，目标是将血尿酸水平维持在特定范围内\"\"\",4\r\n3486,国际精神疾病流行病学联盟,国际精神疾病流行病学联盟 (ICPE) is an international organization that conducts epidemiological research on mental health disorders,3\r\n206,欧洲抗风湿病联盟,\"The **European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR)**, also known as the **European League Against Rheumatism**, is a prominent organization dedicated to advancing rheumatology research, education, and clinical practice.
