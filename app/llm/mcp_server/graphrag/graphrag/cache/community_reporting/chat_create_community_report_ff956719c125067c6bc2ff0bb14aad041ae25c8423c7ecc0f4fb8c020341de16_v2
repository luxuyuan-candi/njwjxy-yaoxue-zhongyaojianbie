This condition is often associated with gout and hyperuricemia, which contribute to the excessive accumulation of uric acid in the body. The stones develop when uric acid crystallizes in the kidneys, leading to obstruction, pain, and potential complications if untreated. Both descriptions emphasize the role of high uric acid levels as the primary cause, linking the condition to metabolic disorders such as gout. The term \"\"尿酸性肾石症\"\" is the Chinese equivalent of \"\"uric acid nephrolithiasis,\"\" further clarifying its definition in a multilingual context. The summary consolidates these perspectives into a coherent explanation, highlighting the condition's etiology and clinical associations.\",2\r\n246,高尿酸血症,\"高尿酸血症（Hyperuricemia）是一种以血液中尿酸水平升高为特征的代谢性疾病，主要由嘌呤代谢紊乱和/或尿酸排泄减少所致。作为痛风的主要病因，高尿酸血症可引发关节炎症、尿酸结晶沉积（如痛风石）及其他并发症，如肾结石或慢性肾病。  \n\n流行病学数据显示，高尿酸血症在中国的患病率较高且存在性别与年龄差异。根据2018年中国慢性病及危险因素监测数据，成人患病率为14.0%，其中男性（24.5%）显著高于女性（3.6%）。青年男性（18~29岁）患病率尤为突出，达32.3%，提示该群体可能受饮食、遗传或代谢因素影响较大。  \n\n此外，高尿酸血症常与其他代谢异常共存，例如高脂血症，二者可能相互加剧，增加心血管疾病风险。这一关联强调了综合管理代谢紊乱的重要性，需通过生活方式干预（如低嘌呤饮食、控制酒精摄入）及药物治疗（如尿酸合成抑制剂或促排泄剂）来降低尿酸水平并预防并发症。  \n\n综上，高尿酸血症是一种需长期关注的慢性病，其防治需结合个体化策略与公共卫生措施，以减轻疾病负担。\",4\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n286,尿酸性肾石症,痛风,Gout patients are at risk for developing uric acid kidney stones,35\r\n261,高尿酸血症,尿酸性肾石症,Persistent hyperuricemia can lead to the formation of uric acid kidney stones,6\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
