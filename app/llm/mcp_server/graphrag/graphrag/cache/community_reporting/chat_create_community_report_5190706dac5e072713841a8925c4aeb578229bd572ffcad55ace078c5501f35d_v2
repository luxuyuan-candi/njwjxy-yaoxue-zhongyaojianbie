The formula is designed to warm the middle jiao (中焦), dispel cold, and alleviate pain caused by these imbalances.  \n\nCombining the provided descriptions, 附子粳米汤 serves as a therapeutic remedy for abdominal discomfort stemming from cold and dampness accumulation, particularly in cases where the spleen and stomach are weakened by cold. Its application reflects classical Chinese medicine principles, emphasizing the restoration of yang energy and the resolution of pathogenic cold-damp factors.  \n\nThe formula's dual focus on warming and resolving dampness makes it a targeted treatment for specific patterns of abdominal pain, aligning with Zhang Zhongjing's broader contributions to cold damage (伤寒) and internal medicine in traditional Chinese medical theory. No contradictions exist between the descriptions; instead, they complement each other by providing clinical context (cold-type pain) and syndrome differentiation (spleen-stomach deficiency with dampness).  \n\nIn summary, 附子粳米汤 is a well-established herbal prescription for cold-induced abdominal pain with underlying spleen-stomach deficiency and dampness retention, rooted in classical Chinese medical texts.\",1\r\n4261,《伤寒论》,\"《伤寒论》是张仲景的医学著作，其中详细描述了阳明经和太阴经的病症，包括腹痛的各种证候变化\"\"\",1\r\n4262,《金匮要略》,\"《金匮要略》是张仲景的另一部医学著作，以专篇方式归纳了内伤、食积、痰湿、瘀血等内因造成的腹痛\"\"\",1\r\n4263,《内经》,\"《内经》是古代医学经典，张仲景继承了其中的腹痛理论与治疗原则\"\"\",1\r\n4264,使君子丸,\"使君子丸是一种中成药，用于驱虫，早晨空腹口服\"\"\",1\r\n4265,大承气汤,\"**大承气汤**是一种传统中药方剂，主要用于通里攻下，治疗腑气闭结及相关症状。其临床应用包括缓解阳明腑实引起的腹满痛、绕脐痛，以及胞宫恶露坚结导致的腹痛。该方剂通过泻下通便、行气导滞的作用，改善因实热积滞或瘀血内阻所致的病症，体现了中医“通因通用”的治疗原则。  \n\n综上所述，大承气汤的核心功效为泻下攻积，适用于实热内结或瘀滞引起的腹部胀满、疼痛及便秘等症状，是中医治疗急腹症及腑实证的经典方剂之一。\",1\r\n4197,大建中汤,\"**大建中汤 (Dà Jiàn Zhōng Tāng)** is a traditional Chinese medicinal formula historically mentioned by the renowned physician Zhang Zhongjing.

The formula is composed of key ingredients such as Sichuan pepper (*Huā Jiāo*), dried ginger (*Gān Jiāng*), and ginseng (*Rén Shēn*), which work synergistically to restore warmth and alleviate discomfort in the abdominal region.  \n\nThis herbal remedy is particularly effective for conditions stemming from internal cold, such as digestive disturbances, cramping, or pain due to deficient yang energy. By combining warming and tonifying herbs, 大建中汤 addresses both the symptoms and underlying imbalances, making it a well-regarded formula in classical Chinese medicine.
