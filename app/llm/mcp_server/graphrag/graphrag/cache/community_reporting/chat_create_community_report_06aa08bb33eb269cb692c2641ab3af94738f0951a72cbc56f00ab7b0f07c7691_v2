It has been clinically proven to reduce cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, making it an effective treatment for managing hyperlipidemia. As with other statins, lovastatin works by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a key role in cholesterol production in the liver.  \n\nWhile effective, lovastatin may cause potential adverse effects, including headaches, gastrointestinal disturbances, and, in rare cases, liver abnormalities. These side effects are consistent with those observed in other statin medications. Despite these risks, lovastatin remains a widely prescribed treatment due to its efficacy in lowering LDL cholesterol and improving cardiovascular health.  \n\nThe drug is referenced in medical literature as a well-established statin, reinforcing its role in cholesterol management. Overall, lovastatin is a balanced therapeutic option, offering moderate potency with a manageable safety profile for patients requiring lipid-lowering therapy.\",11\r\n3918,STATIN CLASS,,4\r\n3857,CLOFIBRATE,\"**Clofibrate (Atromid-S)** is a lipid-lowering drug classified as a fibrate, primarily used to reduce elevated levels of triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol in the blood. It functions by modulating lipid metabolism, though the exact mechanism remains partially understood.  \n\nClofibrate is marketed under the brand name *Atromid-S* and is prescribed to manage hyperlipidemia, particularly in patients with high triglyceride levels. However, its use is accompanied by specific contraindications and potential side effects, which may include gastrointestinal disturbances, muscle pain, and, in rare cases, more severe reactions such as liver dysfunction or increased risk of gallstones. Due to these risks, its administration requires careful patient monitoring and adherence to prescribed guidelines.  \n\nWhile effective in lowering lipids, clofibrate has largely been replaced by newer fibrates with improved safety profiles. Nonetheless, it remains a recognized therapeutic option in certain clinical contexts. The drug should only be used under medical supervision, considering individual patient factors and potential drug interactions.\",2\r\n3894,IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS,\"Drugs that may interact dangerously with lovastatin, increasing risk of muscle disease\"\"\",1\r\n3896,ANTICOAGULANTS,\"Medications that may interact with lovastatin, potentially causing bleeding complications\"\"\",1\r\n3908,XUE ZHI KANG,Xue Zhi Kang is a statin-class lipid-lowering drug mentioned in the text,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3201,PRAVASTATIN,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,Pravastatin is a prescribed medication for treating high lipidemia,61\r\n3926,LOVASTATIN,SIMVASTATIN,Both are statin drugs with similar side effect profiles,22\r\n3947,LOVASTATIN,STATIN CLASS,Lovastatin belongs to the statin class of lipid-lowering drugs,15\r\n3928,LOVASTATIN,CLOFIBRATE,Both are lipid-lowering drugs with different mechanisms and side effects,13\r\n3929,LOVASTATIN,IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS,Concurrent use may cause dangerous muscle disease,12\r\n3931,LOVASTATIN,ANTICOAGULANTS,May cause prolonged bleeding time when used together,12\r\n3948,XUE ZHI KANG,STATIN CLASS,Xue Zhi Kang belongs to the statin class of lipid-lowering drugs,5\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
