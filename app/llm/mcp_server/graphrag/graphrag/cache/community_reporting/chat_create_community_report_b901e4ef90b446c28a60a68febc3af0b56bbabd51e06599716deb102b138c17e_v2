ASCVD is a major focus for **prevention and treatment**, particularly in patients with **hypertension, high cholesterol, or diabetes**, as these conditions significantly increase cardiovascular risk.  \n\nThe **10-year risk assessment** of ASCVD is used to guide clinical decisions, such as **lipid-lowering therapy (e.g., statins), glucose-lowering treatments, and hypertension management strategies**. Additionally, **antiplatelet therapy** is often recommended for **secondary prevention** in affected individuals. ASCVD is closely linked to **elevated cholesterol levels** and is considered a **key complication of both hypertension and diabetes**.  \n\nIn summary, ASCVD is a systemic arterial disease with significant implications for cardiovascular health, requiring **risk assessment, targeted therapies, and preventive measures** to mitigate complications.\",45\n4383,TC,\"TC, which stands for Total Cholesterol (总胆固醇 in Chinese), is a key lipid marker measured in blood tests to assess cardiovascular risk.

It is a key biomarker in cardiovascular health, as elevated levels can lead to buildup in the arteries, contributing to atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular conditions. LDL-C is the primary target for lipid-lowering therapies, including medications such as PCSK9 inhibitors (e.g., inclisiran), statins (e.g.,血脂康 [Xuezhikang]), and other treatments aimed at reducing its levels in hypertensive patients and those at risk for cardiovascular disease. The management of LDL-C is critical in preventing and mitigating cardiovascular risks.\",28\n1371,HDL-C,\"**HDL-C (High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol)** is an important lipid marker often referred to as \"\"good cholesterol\"\" due to its protective role against cardiovascular disease. It functions by helping to remove LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) cholesterol from the arteries, thereby reducing the risk of plaque buildup.

They are commonly prescribed for patients who do not achieve their target LDL-C levels with statins and ezetimibe alone. PCSK9 inhibitors are often used in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies to optimize cholesterol management.
