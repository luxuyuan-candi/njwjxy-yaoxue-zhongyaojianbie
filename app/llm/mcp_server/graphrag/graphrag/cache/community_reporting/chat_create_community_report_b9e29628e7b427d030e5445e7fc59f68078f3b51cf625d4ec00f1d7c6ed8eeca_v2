It is a leading cause of death globally, particularly in China, where it accounts for over 45% of total deaths.  \n\nThe disease is influenced by multiple risk factors, including high blood pressure (both isolated systolic hypertension [ISH] and increased diastolic pressure [IDH]), elevated cholesterol levels, smoking, and physical inactivity. Hypertension, in particular, is strongly correlated with cardiovascular disease, as elevated systolic pressure increases mortality and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, while IDH is linked to higher risks of cerebral hemorrhage, cardiovascular mortality, and other complications, especially in younger patients.  \n\nLifestyle modifications and medical interventions can mitigate risks. Smoking cessation reduces cardiovascular disease risk, while medications such as SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) have been shown to lower the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. Effective blood pressure management is also crucial in reducing the incidence and severity of cardiovascular disease.  \n\nOverall, cardiovascular disease represents a major public health challenge, with prevention and treatment strategies focusing on controlling modifiable risk factors and utilizing targeted therapies.\",26\n1053,SMOKING,\"\nSmoking is identified as a risk factor for mortality, cardiovascular disease, and stroke in the Syst-China trial\",3\n910,EGFR (ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE),\"Measure of kidney function used to assess cardiovascular risk in hypertension\"\"\",1\n911,UACR (URINE ALBUMIN-TO-CREATININE RATIO),\"Marker of kidney damage that predicts cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients\"\"\",1\n1474,ELDERLY ISH PATIENTS,A demographic group (age >60) with high ISH prevalence (30.33% in China) and elevated cardiovascular risk.,2\n1475,SHEP,The Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) is a study that showed reduced major cardiovascular events with lowered systolic blood pressure in elderly patients with isolated systolic hypertension (ISH),1\n1511,PREECLAMPSIA,\"**Preeclampsia** is a serious pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure (hypertension) and signs of damage to other organ systems, most commonly the kidneys, as indicated by proteinuria (excess protein in the urine).
