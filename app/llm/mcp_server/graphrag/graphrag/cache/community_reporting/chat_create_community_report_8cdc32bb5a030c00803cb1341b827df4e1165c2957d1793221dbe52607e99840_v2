The country has developed age and height-specific blood pressure reference standards for males and females aged 3–17 years and is referenced in the Asia-Pacific cohort study for the strong correlation between blood pressure levels and stroke or coronary heart disease events.  \n\nChina faces significant health challenges, including a high prevalence of hypertension, with over 20 million people suffering from Grade 3 hypertension, as well as metabolic syndrome, particularly among women, the elderly, and rural populations. It also has the largest and fastest-aging elderly population, contributing to rising health concerns such as obesity and hypertension. Several intervention trials, including the SSaSS and DECIDE-Salt studies, have been conducted in China to improve hypertension management. Additionally, depression prevalence studies indicate a lifetime prevalence of 3.3–3.4%.  \n\nLong-term chronic disease prevention and control policies are being implemented in China, with plans extending until 2025.
