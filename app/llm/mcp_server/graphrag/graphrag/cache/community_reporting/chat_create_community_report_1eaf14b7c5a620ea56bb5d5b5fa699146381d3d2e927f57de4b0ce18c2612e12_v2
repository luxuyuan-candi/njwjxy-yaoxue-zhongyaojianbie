These include a variety of animal-based products and processed items. Examples of high-fat foods to limit or avoid are fatty meats (such as pork, beef, or lamb with visible fat), processed meats (like sausages and bacon), and animal organs (including pig brain, cow brain, sheep brain, and chicken liver). Additionally, certain seafood items, such as fish roe, ribbon fish, eel, squid, and yellow eel, are also high in fat and should be eaten in moderation.  \n\nThe descriptions emphasize the importance of reducing intake of these foods due to their potential negative health effects, such as contributing to cardiovascular disease or weight gain. While some variations exist in the listed examples (e.g., one description highlights organ meats and seafood, while the other focuses on fatty and processed meats), the overarching message is consistent: HIGH-FAT FOODS should be carefully managed in a healthy diet.  \n\nTo ensure clarity, the combined summary resolves minor discrepancies by including all mentioned items while maintaining a cohesive recommendation—prioritizing reduced consumption of high-fat animal products and processed foods for better health outcomes.\",6\r\n3687,LOW-FAT DIET,\"A low-fat diet plan is provided, including meals like skim milk, cornmeal cake, and stir-fried eggplant\",4\r\n3693,PROCESSED MEATS,Processed meat products like sausages should be avoided in a low-cholesterol diet,1\r\n3694,FATTY MEATS,\"Fatty cuts of pork, beef, and lamb should be limited in consumption\",1\r\n3695,POULTRY SKIN,Chicken and duck skin should be avoided due to high fat content,1\r\n3689,DAIRY PRODUCTS,\"Dairy products like milk are recommended, but full-fat dairy products should be limited\",1\r\n3690,COOKING OILS,\"Recommended cooking oils include peanut oil, sunflower oil, and sesame oil, while animal fats should be avoided\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3402,HIGH-FAT FOODS,WEIGHT MANAGEMENT,Avoiding high-fat foods helps in weight management,13\r\n3633,LOW-FAT DIET,HIGH-FAT FOODS,Low-fat diet aims to reduce intake of high-fat foods,10\r\n3637,HIGH-FAT FOODS,PROCESSED MEATS,Processed meats belong to the category of high-fat foods,7\r\n3638,HIGH-FAT FOODS,FATTY MEATS,Fatty meats are primary examples of high-fat foods,7\r\n3639,HIGH-FAT FOODS,POULTRY SKIN,Poultry skin is a significant source of dietary fat,7\r\n3634,LOW-FAT DIET,DAIRY PRODUCTS,Low-fat dairy products are part of the recommended low-fat diet,5\r\n3635,LOW-FAT DIET,COOKING OILS,Recommended cooking oils are part of the low-fat diet plan,5\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
