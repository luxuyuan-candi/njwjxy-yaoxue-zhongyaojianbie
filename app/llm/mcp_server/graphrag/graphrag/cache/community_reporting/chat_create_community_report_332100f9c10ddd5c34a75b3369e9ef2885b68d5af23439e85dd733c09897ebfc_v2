It is a key component of cell membranes, providing structural integrity, and serves as a raw material for the synthesis of steroid hormones (such as cortisol, estrogen, and testosterone) and bile acids, which aid in digestion. While cholesterol is essential for normal bodily functions, excessive levels—particularly of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol—can contribute to cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and heart disease.  \n\nDietary cholesterol is found exclusively in animal-based foods, with varying concentrations depending on the source. Foods high in cholesterol include egg yolks, organ meats (such as animal brains and liver), fatty cuts of meat, fish roe (eggs), and high-fat dairy products like cream. Due to its association with increased cardiovascular risk, health guidelines often recommend limiting cholesterol intake, particularly in low-fat or heart-healthy diets. However, recent research suggests that dietary cholesterol has a less significant impact on blood cholesterol levels for most people compared to saturated and trans fats.  \n\nIn summary, cholesterol is a crucial biological molecule with structural and metabolic functions, but its levels must be carefully regulated to maintain health. A balanced diet and lifestyle are important for managing cholesterol and reducing the risk of related diseases.\",23\r\n2181,GONADS,The gonads release hormones that are synthesized from cholesterol,1\r\n2298,TOKYO UNIVERSITY,Tokyo University researchers proposed that high-cholesterol foods might be beneficial for the elderly,1\r\n2400,VITAMIN,Vitamin is mentioned as having a function to promote lipid metabolism,1\r\n2438,MUSHROOMS,Mushrooms contain 'Xianggu Su' (香菇素) which can lower cholesterol without affecting fat digestion,1\r\n2464,PLANT-BASED FOODS,\"Plant-based foods are generally low in cholesterol.\"\"\",1\r\n2465,ANIMAL-BASED FOODS,\"Animal-based foods contain varying levels of cholesterol, with some being high in cholesterol.\"\"\",1\r\n2467,EGG WHITES,\"Egg whites are recommended for consumption 3-4 times a week, while egg yolks should be limited\",1\r\n2742,BILE ACID SEQUESTRANTS,\"**Bile Acid Sequestrants** are a class of drugs primarily used to lower cholesterol and lipid levels in the blood. These medications work by binding to bile acids in the intestine, preventing their reabsorption and promoting their excretion. This process forces the liver to use excess cholesterol to produce more bile acids, thereby reducing circulating cholesterol levels.  \n\nCommonly prescribed bile acid sequestrants include **cholestyramine**, **colestipol**, and **colesevelam**. These drugs are often utilized as part of lipid-lowering therapy, particularly for patients with hypercholesterolemia or those seeking adjunctive treatment alongside statins or lifestyle modifications. While effective, they may cause gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation or bloating.  \n\nBy targeting bile acid metabolism, bile acid sequestrants provide a non-systemic approach to cholesterol management, making them a valuable option in certain clinical scenarios. Their mechanism of action distinguishes them from other lipid-lowering agents, offering an alternative for patients who may not tolerate other therapies.\",1\r\n2173,SMALL INTESTINE,\"The **small intestine** plays a critical role in the digestion and absorption of fats. It is the primary site where bile, produced by the liver and stored in the gallbladder, mixes with digested fats. Bile aids in the breakdown of fats into glycerol and fatty acids, facilitating their absorption. Additionally, the small intestine is where bile acids are reabsorbed into the bloodstream, allowing them to be recycled for further use in digestion. This dual function—breaking down fats and reabsorbing bile acids—ensures efficient fat metabolism and nutrient absorption in the digestive process.  \n\nIn summary, the small intestine is essential for fat digestion, leveraging bile to emulsify and break down fats while also reclaiming bile acids for reuse, maintaining a continuous cycle for optimal digestive efficiency.\",4\r\n2174,GALLBLADDER,\"The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ that plays a key role in the digestive system by storing and concentrating bile, a fluid produced by the liver. Its primary function is to store bile and release it into the small intestine when needed to aid in the digestion and emulsification of dietary fats. By doing so, the gallbladder ensures efficient fat breakdown and absorption during digestion. The bile stored in the gallbladder is initially secreted by the liver, highlighting the organ's role as a intermediary reservoir rather than a producer of bile.
