It encompasses various conditions, often linked to hypertension (high blood pressure), hyperlipidemia (elevated cholesterol levels), and other risk factors such as poor dietary habits. These disorders are frequently associated with complications arising from uncontrolled hypertension, emphasizing the need for proactive risk assessment and management.  \n\nThe disease is influenced by multiple factors, including lifestyle choices like diet, as well as physiological conditions such as high cholesterol and sustained high blood pressure. Its prevalence and severity underscore the importance of early detection, preventive measures, and long-term management strategies to mitigate its impact. Collectively, cardiovascular disease represents a significant public health challenge, requiring comprehensive approaches to address its underlying causes and associated complications.  \n\nIn summary, cardiovascular disease involves a spectrum of heart and blood vessel disorders, driven by hypertension, cholesterol imbalances, and modifiable risk factors. Effective prevention and management are critical to reducing its global burden. (Word count: 178)\",9\r\n828,HYPERTENSION,\"**Hypertension (HYPERTENSION)** is a chronic medical condition characterized by consistently elevated blood pressure, typically defined as ≥140/90 mmHg. It is influenced by renal, hormonal, and neural mechanisms and often coexists with hyperlipidemia (high lipid levels), which can exacerbate the condition. Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure, and may also lead to other serious complications if left unmanaged.  \n\nThe condition frequently requires lifelong treatment and management, involving a combination of lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions. Dietary approaches, such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, are commonly recommended to help control blood pressure. Additionally, regular medical follow-ups are essential to monitor the condition and adjust treatment plans as needed.  \n\nHypertension is often associated with hyperlipidemia, and the interplay between these conditions increases the risk of cardiovascular events. Symptoms, such as headaches, may prompt detection, though many cases are asymptomatic until complications arise. Research on hypertension extends to animal studies, where dietary changes have been shown to influence blood pressure and stroke risk.  \n\nManagement strategies vary depending on the severity of the condition. Uncomplicated cases may be addressed through lifestyle interventions, while complicated cases often require multiple medications. The overarching goal of treatment is to prevent long-term health consequences, emphasizing the importance of adherence to prescribed regimens and regular healthcare supervision.  \n\nIn summary, hypertension is a prevalent, multifactorial condition with significant implications for cardiovascular health, necessitating proactive and sustained management to mitigate risks and improve outcomes.\",39\r\n955,HONEST,\"The **HONEST** study is a large-scale prospective, real-world observational study focused on investigating the relationship between home blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular outcomes in patients undergoing antihypertensive therapy. Designed as a comprehensive research initiative, it aims to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of home-based blood pressure measurements in predicting and managing cardiovascular events.  \n\nBy leveraging real-world data, the study evaluates long-term trends and outcomes, offering a practical perspective on antihypertensive treatment outside controlled clinical settings. The dual descriptions emphasize its observational, non-interventional nature, highlighting its role in bridging gaps between clinical trials and everyday patient care.  \n\nIn summary, **HONEST** serves as a critical resource for understanding the implications of home blood pressure monitoring in cardiovascular risk assessment, reinforcing its importance in hypertension management. The study’s prospective design ensures robust, longitudinal data collection, contributing to evidence-based guidelines for patient care.\",5\r\n2330,HIGH BLOOD LIPIDS,\"High blood lipids is a condition that can lead to hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke, often caused by lifestyle and dietary habits\"\"\",3\r\n827,KIDNEYS,\"The kidneys play a critical role in sodium excretion and blood pressure regulation, with dysfunction leading to hypertension\"\"\",2\r\n2230,CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE,\"**Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** is a progressive condition characterized by impaired kidney function over time. It poses significant health risks, including cardiovascular complications, particularly in hypertensive patients. CKD is also associated with metabolic disturbances, such as secondary high cholesterol, which further exacerbates cardiovascular risks.

This arterial narrowing restricts blood flow to the heart, potentially leading to serious complications such as heart attacks, myocardial ischemia, or sudden death.  \n\nCHD is closely linked to **high lipid levels**, particularly elevated **low-density lipoprotein (LDL)** and **very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)**, as well as reduced **high-density lipoprotein (HDL)**, which exacerbates atherosclerosis. Other contributing factors include **high cholesterol**, **triglycerides**, **hypertension**, **diabetes**, **obesity**, **smoking**, and **unhealthy dietary habits**—such as excessive intake of saturated and trans fats. Lifestyle modifications, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and smoking cessation, can mitigate risks.  \n\nThe disease's progression is influenced by **age**, **gender**, and **family history**, with varying incidence rates between men and women. Additionally, conditions like **hyperlipidemia** and **hypertension** further elevate CHD risk. Early detection through lipid profile assessments and management of underlying risk factors are critical in preventing severe outcomes.  \n\nIn summary, CHD arises from a combination of **atherosclerosis**, **dyslipidemia**, and **lifestyle factors**, underscoring the importance of proactive cardiovascular health management.\",29\r\n2277,HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"**High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)** is a type of cholesterol often referred to as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol due to its protective effects on cardiovascular health. It functions primarily to remove excess cholesterol from blood vessels and tissues, helping to prevent arterial hardening and atherosclerosis, earning it the nickname \"\"anti-atherosclerotic lipoprotein.\"\" HDL works by transporting other forms of cholesterol, such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL), away from the bloodstream and arterial walls, reducing the risk of plaque buildup and improving heart health.  \n\nIn addition to its role in cholesterol clearance, HDL is associated with broader health benefits. Studies indicate that reduced HDL levels may be linked to adverse outcomes in stroke patients and hypertension, particularly in animal models. Elevated HDL levels, on the other hand, are correlated with improved cardiovascular outcomes and can be achieved through lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise, weight loss, smoking cessation, and dietary adjustments.  \n\nWhile HDL is universally recognized as beneficial, its mechanisms extend beyond cholesterol transport, influencing inflammation and endothelial function. Its multifaceted role underscores its importance in maintaining cardiovascular health and mitigating disease risks.\",7\r\n2187,ARTERIOSCLEROSIS,\"**ARTERIOSCLEROSIS** is a chronic cardiovascular condition characterized by the hardening and narrowing of arterial walls due to the accumulation of plaque, primarily composed of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), lipoprotein(a), and triglycerides. This buildup leads to reduced blood flow and increased risk of complications such as blockages. The disease is often associated with elevated lipid levels, including high cholesterol (particularly LDL) and serum triglycerides, which contribute to arterial stiffening and plaque formation.  \n\nArteriosclerosis is frequently diagnosed through lipid profile tests, which may reveal abnormal levels of these lipids. Treatment commonly involves statin-based lipid-lowering drugs to manage cholesterol and slow disease progression. While high cholesterol is a primary cause, other factors such as hypertension, smoking, and diabetes can also contribute to its development.  \n\nThe condition is sometimes conflated with atherosclerosis (a specific type of arteriosclerosis), but it broadly refers to arterial hardening from multiple causes, including lipid imbalances. Descriptions may vary in emphasis—some highlight cholesterol buildup, while others focus on triglyceride elevation—but all agree on the central role of lipid dysfunction and arterial stiffening. The disease requires long-term management to prevent severe cardiovascular events like heart attacks or strokes.  \n\nIn summary, arteriosclerosis is a progressive arterial disease driven by lipid accumulation, leading to vessel hardening and narrowing, with treatment centered on lipid control and risk factor modification.\",11\r\n19,STROKE,\"**STROKE** is a serious medical condition characterized by impaired or interrupted blood flow to the brain, leading to cell death and neurological deficits. It is a cerebrovascular event often caused by atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, or other vascular blockages, which restrict oxygen and nutrient supply to brain tissues. Stroke is strongly associated with high lipid levels (lipidemia), particularly elevated cholesterol, and is frequently linked to hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors.  \n\nThe condition can result in severe complications, including hemiplegia (paralysis on one side of the body), hand dysfunction, gait abnormalities, and impaired daily living activities, significantly affecting quality of life. Rehabilitation, often involving orthoses and physical therapy, is commonly required to manage these long-term effects.  \n\nStroke is considered a medical emergency, as timely intervention is critical to minimize brain damage. Prevention strategies focus on controlling risk factors such as high blood lipids, hypertension, and poor diet, with dietary modifications playing a key role in reducing incidence. Lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) have been observed in stroke patients, further emphasizing the connection between lipid metabolism and stroke risk.  \n\nEpidemiologically, stroke is recognized as a leading cause of disability and mortality, with research highlighting its association with high lipidemia as one of its \"\"dangerous partners.\"\" Management includes acute treatment, secondary prevention, and long-term rehabilitation to address functional impairments.  \n\nIn summary, stroke is a multifaceted condition with significant neurological consequences, driven primarily by vascular and metabolic factors. Its prevention and treatment require a comprehensive approach targeting underlying causes such as high lipid levels, hypertension, and atherosclerosis.\",24\r\n2203,VERY LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"Very low-density lipoprotein is another atherogenic lipoprotein whose elevated levels are linked to the occurrence of coronary heart disease, primarily containing triglycerides>\",2\r\n2204,INTERMEDIATE DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,Intermediate-density lipoprotein may have a mild atherogenic effect>,2\r\n2205,CHYLOMICRON,\"Chylomicron, mainly containing triglycerides, has no significant atherogenic effect>\",2\r\n2341,HIGH BLOOD LIPID DISEASE,\"High blood lipid disease is a condition characterized by elevated low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides, and reduced high-density lipoprotein, leading to coronary heart disease and hypertension\",2\r\n2663,SATURATED FATTY ACIDS,\"Saturated fatty acids are found in animal meats, dairy products, and animal fats, and are known to raise blood lipids and increase the risk of heart disease\"\"\",1\r\n2739,PRIMARY PREVENTION,\"Primary prevention involves lowering cholesterol in individuals with risk factors for coronary heart disease but no existing condition.\"\"\",1\r\n2740,SECONDARY PREVENTION,\"Secondary prevention involves lowering cholesterol in individuals already diagnosed with coronary heart disease to prevent further complications.\"\"\",1\r\n2741,ANGINA,\"Chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscles, often a symptom of coronary artery disease\",1\r\n2214,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,\"**High Blood Pressure**  \n\nHigh blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a common medical condition that significantly increases the risk of serious cardiovascular diseases, including heart disease and stroke. It frequently occurs in individuals who are obese, maintain unhealthy diets, or have a family history of hypertension or high cholesterol. The condition is closely linked to high cholesterol, further exacerbating cardiovascular risks.  \n\nWhile high blood pressure can affect a wide range of people, certain lifestyle and genetic factors heighten susceptibility. Managing the condition often involves dietary changes, weight management, and, in some cases, medication to reduce long-term health complications. The interplay between hypertension, cholesterol, and cardiovascular health underscores the importance of early detection and proactive management.\",4\r\n1575,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,\"**High Lipidemia** is a medical condition characterized by elevated levels of lipids—including cholesterol and triglycerides—in the blood. It is often caused by dietary and lifestyle factors such as excessive alcohol consumption, high-fat diets, lack of exercise, and genetic predisposition. Poor management of these factors can lead to serious health complications, including pancreatitis, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and metabolic disorders. High lipidemia is also a significant global health concern, acting as a \"\"silent killer\"\" and a major contributor to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.  \n\nThe condition is typically managed through dietary adjustments, regular exercise, and medication. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), high lipidemia is classified under categories such as \"\"blood stasis,\"\" \"\"phlegm-dampness,\"\" and \"\"lipid turbidity.\"\" TCM views it as a deficiency-excess syndrome, where phlegm and stasis are the manifestations, while deficiency serves as the root cause.  \n\nGiven its association with multiple systemic health risks, early detection and intervention are crucial to prevent long-term complications. Lifestyle modifications, alongside medical treatment, play a key role in controlling lipid levels and reducing the risk of associated diseases.\",25\r\n2168,LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"**Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)** is a type of lipoprotein responsible for transporting cholesterol into surrounding tissues, including blood vessels. It accounts for approximately 75% of total cholesterol in the body. LDL plays a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of arterial plaques. When LDL levels are elevated, it deposits cholesterol in the walls of arteries, contributing to plaque formation and narrowing of the blood vessels. This process increases the risk of coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular complications. Due to its role in cholesterol transport and plaque accumulation, LDL is often referred to as \"\"bad cholesterol.\"\" Elevated LDL levels are strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, making it a critical biomarker in cardiovascular health assessments.\",5\r\n2169,HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"**High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)** is a type of cholesterol commonly referred to as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol due to its beneficial effects on heart health. HDL accounts for approximately 25% of total cholesterol in the body and plays a critical role in transporting excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver for processing and excretion, a process known as reverse cholesterol transport. This function helps prevent the buildup of cholesterol in arteries, thereby reducing the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.  \n\nHDL is measured in millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), with higher levels generally associated with better cardiovascular protection. Low HDL levels, conversely, correlate with an increased incidence of coronary heart disease. Beyond cholesterol transport, HDL activates key enzymes involved in lipoprotein metabolism and contributes to the clearance of cholesterol from tissues, further supporting its protective role in the cardiovascular system.  \n\nOverall, HDL is recognized for its ability to safeguard against heart disease by promoting efficient cholesterol removal and maintaining arterial health. Its multifaceted functions underscore its importance in cardiovascular risk assessment and preventive health strategies.\",5\r\n2352,KIDNEY DISEASE,\"**Kidney Disease** is a medical condition that can both result from and contribute to other health complications. It is often linked to **hypertension (high blood pressure)**, as prolonged elevated blood pressure can damage the kidneys over time, impairing their function. Conversely, kidney disease can also lead to metabolic disturbances, such as **high lipidemia (elevated levels of lipids in the blood)**, due to the kidneys' role in filtering and regulating bodily fluids and waste. Thus, kidney disease exists in a bidirectional relationship with certain systemic conditions, where it may arise as a consequence of hypertension while also exacerbating or triggering lipid metabolism disorders. Proper management of kidney disease involves addressing both its underlying causes and its potential secondary effects on overall health.\",2\r\n20,HAND ORTHOSIS,\"Devices used to correct or support hand function, including fixed and functional types, made from materials like low-temperature thermoplastics or aluminum\"\"\",2\r\n1576,TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE,\"Traditional Chinese Medicine is a medical system that diagnoses and treats high lipidemia by addressing imbalances in the liver, spleen, and kidney functions, and the accumulation of pathological products like stasis, dampness, and phlegm.\"\"\",1\r\n2218,XANTHOMA,\"Yellowish deposits of fat under the skin, often indicative of high lipid levels, with various types like eyelid xanthoma, tendon xanthoma, and palmar xanthoma>\",1\r\n2294,CIRRHOSIS,\"Cirrhosis is a late-stage liver disease that can be caused by high lipidemia leading to fatty liver and subsequent liver damage.\"\"\",1\r\n2295,PANCREATITIS,\"Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, which can be triggered by high lipidemia.\"\"\",1\r\n2296,GALLSTONES,\"Gallstones are hardened deposits in the gallbladder, often associated with high lipidemia.\"\"\",1\r\n2338,STATINS,\"**Statins** are a class of lipid-lowering drugs primarily used to reduce cholesterol levels by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a central role in cholesterol production in the liver. They are considered the first-line treatment for patients with arteriosclerosis and high-risk groups due to their efficacy in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, moderately reducing very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglycerides, and slightly increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels.  \n\nIn addition to cholesterol reduction, statins help stabilize atherosclerotic plaques, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. They are particularly effective in treating hypercholesterolemia and are often combined with other lipid-lowering agents for managing mixed hyperlipidemia. Commonly prescribed statins include **Lovastatin, Simvastatin, Pravastatin, and Atorvastatin**.  \n\nStatins are generally well-tolerated and do not exhibit significant interactions with antihypertensive medications, making them suitable for patients with concurrent hypertension. Their multifaceted benefits—cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition, plaque stabilization, and cardiovascular risk reduction—solidify their role as a cornerstone in lipid management therapy.\",14\r\n2157,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,\"**Atherosclerosis** is a chronic cardiovascular disease characterized by the progressive buildup of fatty plaques, primarily composed of cholesterol, lipids, and other substances, on the inner walls of arteries. This accumulation leads to the narrowing and hardening of the arteries, a process known as arteriosclerosis, which restricts blood flow and increases the risk of serious complications such as coronary heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes.  \n\nThe condition is strongly associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, often referred to as \"\"bad\"\" cholesterol, as well as high lipidemia (excessive fats in the blood). These factors contribute to plaque formation, which can eventually rupture, triggering blood clots that further obstruct circulation. Conversely, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, known as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol, plays a protective role by helping to remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream, thereby slowing the progression of atherosclerosis.  \n\nAtherosclerosis develops gradually and is influenced by multiple risk factors, including poor diet, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and genetic predisposition. Over time, the narrowing of arteries reduces oxygen and nutrient supply to vital organs, potentially leading to life-threatening cardiovascular events.  \n\nIn summary, atherosclerosis is a systemic disease driven by lipid imbalances, particularly high LDL cholesterol, and is marked by arterial plaque buildup, arterial stiffening, and impaired blood flow. Management focuses on lifestyle modifications, cholesterol-lowering medications, and controlling underlying conditions to mitigate its progression and associated risks.\",12\r\n2347,THYROID

DISEASE,\"**Summary of HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) and CORONARY HEART DISEASE (CHD):**  \n\nHigh-density lipoprotein (HDL), often referred to as \"\"good cholesterol,\"\" plays a protective role against coronary heart disease (CHD) through multiple mechanisms. Primarily, HDL helps reduce the risk of CHD by removing excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and transporting it to the liver for excretion, thereby preventing the buildup of arterial plaque. This process not only mitigates atherosclerosis—a key contributor to CHD—but also supports overall cardiovascular health.  \n\nAdditionally, research indicates that low levels of HDL are associated with an increased risk of developing CHD, underscoring its importance as a biomarker for cardiovascular risk. The inverse relationship between HDL levels and CHD risk highlights HDL's critical function in maintaining healthy cholesterol balance and protecting against arterial damage.  \n\nIn summary, HDL serves as a vital defense against coronary heart disease by promoting cholesterol clearance, reducing plaque formation, and lowering overall cardiovascular risk. Maintaining adequate HDL levels is therefore essential for heart health.\",36\r\n1649,ARTERIOSCLEROSIS,STROKE,Arteriosclerosis in the brain's arteries can lead to strokes.,35\r\n1595,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,UNITED STATES,The United States recommends lipid checks for children at risk of coronary heart disease,32\r\n1529,VERY LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,Increased levels of very low-density lipoprotein are associated with the occurrence of coronary heart disease,31\r\n1533,INTERMEDIATE DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,Intermediate-density lipoprotein may contribute mildly to the development of coronary heart disease,31\r\n1535,CHYLOMICRON,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,Chylomicron has no significant effect on the development of coronary heart disease,31\r\n1775,HIGH BLOOD LIPID DISEASE,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,High blood lipid disease is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease,31\r\n2082,SATURATED FATTY ACIDS,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,\"Saturated fatty acids contribute to elevated blood lipids, increasing the risk of coronary heart disease\",30\r\n2104,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,PRIMARY PREVENTION,Primary prevention aims to reduce the risk of developing coronary heart disease.,30\r\n2105,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,SECONDARY PREVENTION,Secondary prevention aims to manage and reduce complications in individuals already diagnosed with coronary heart disease.,30\r\n2108,CORONARY HEART DISEASE,ANGINA,Angina is a symptom of coronary heart disease,30\r\n1542,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,High blood pressure and high lipidemia are both risk factors for cardiovascular diseases,29\r\n1487,LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CHOLESTEROL,LDL carries cholesterol into surrounding tissues,28\r\n1488,HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CHOLESTEROL,HDL transports cholesterol from tissues back to the liver,28\r\n1797,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,KIDNEY DISEASE,Kidney disease can cause high lipidemia,27\r\n12,STROKE,HAND ORTHOSIS,Stroke patients often require hand orthoses for rehabilitation,26\r\n1115,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,TRADITIONAL CHINESE MEDICINE,\"Traditional Chinese Medicine provides diagnostic and treatment approaches for high lipidemia, categorizing it under specific syndromes and suggesting dietary and lifestyle adjustments.\",26\r\n1550,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,XANTHOMA,\"High lipidemia can cause xanthomas, which are symptomatic of lipid metabolism disorders\",26\r\n1678,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,CIRRHOSIS,High lipidemia can progress to cirrhosis via fatty liver disease.,26\r\n1679,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,PANCREATITIS,High lipidemia can trigger pancreatitis.,26\r\n1680,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,GALLSTONES,High lipidemia is associated with the formation of gallstones.,26\r\n1762,STATINS,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,Statins help stabilize atherosclerotic plaques and prevent their rupture,26\r\n1789,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,THYROID FUNCTION,Impaired thyroid function can lead to high lipidemia by disrupting lipid metabolism,26\r\n1790,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,FAMILIAL HYPERLIPIDEMIA,Familial hyperlipidemia is a genetic cause of high lipidemia,26\r\n1796,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,THYROID FUNCTION DECLINE,Thyroid function decline can cause high lipidemia,26\r\n1813,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,ALCOHOLISM,Alcoholism is a contributing factor to late-stage high lipidemia,26\r\n1868,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,SOY PROTEIN,Soy protein is recommended in the diet for managing high lipidemia,26\r\n13,STROKE,WRIST ORTHOSIS,Stroke patients may need wrist orthoses to support weakened muscles,25\r\n873,STROKE,INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE,Intracerebral hemorrhage is a type of stroke.,25\r\n3077,STROKE,ADL,\"Stroke affects Activities of Daily Living, and rehabilitation focuses on their recovery\",25\r\n3078,STROKE,MORRIS,Morris researched high-intensity progressive resistance training for stroke patients,25\r\n3079,STROKE,YOU,You researched functional electrical stimulation for stroke patients,25\r\n3080,STROKE,YAMAGUCHI,Yamaguchi researched functional electrical stimulation for stroke patients,25\r\n3186,STROKE,CLINICAL REHABILITATION,Clinical Rehabilitation publishes research on stroke rehabilitation outcomes,25\r\n3187,STROKE,NEUROREHABILITATION,NeuroRehabilitation publishes studies on functional electrical stimulation and other rehabilitation methods for stroke patients,25\r\n3188,STROKE,BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,Biomedical Research International publishes research on brain lesion locations and spasticity in stroke patients,25\r\n3189,STROKE,PM&R (PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION),PM&R publishes research on predictors and management of post-stroke spasticity,25\r\n3190,STROKE,JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF THAILAND,The journal published a multicenter study on post-stroke spasticity prevalence and management in Thailand,25\r\n3235,STROKE,CHURCH C,Church C published research in the journal Stroke,25\r\n3241,THROMBOSIS RESEARCH,STROKE,Both journals published research related to stroke and its complications,25\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities -
