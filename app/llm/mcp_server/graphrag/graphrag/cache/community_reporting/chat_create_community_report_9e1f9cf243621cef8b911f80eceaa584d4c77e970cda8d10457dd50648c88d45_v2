Calculated using an individual's height and weight, BMI provides a standardized method to categorize weight status, helping healthcare professionals identify potential health risks associated with underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obesity. While BMI does not directly measure body fat, it is a practical and accessible screening tool for population-level health assessments. Its simplicity and consistency make it a common reference in clinical and public health settings, though it may not account for variations in muscle mass, bone density, or fat distribution among individuals. Overall, BMI remains a key metric for evaluating weight-related health risks.\",4\r\n1160,LVMI,\"**LVMI (Left Ventricular Mass Index)** is a clinical measure used to assess the thickness of the left ventricular heart muscle, particularly in the context of evaluating left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). It serves as an important indicator of target organ damage, especially in patients with hypertension, helping clinicians gauge the impact of elevated blood pressure on cardiac structure. By standardizing left ventricular mass relative to body size, LVMI provides a more accurate assessment of heart muscle thickening compared to absolute measurements.
