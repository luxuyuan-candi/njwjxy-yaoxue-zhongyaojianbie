Launched in December 2021, the journal covers a broad spectrum of topics in general practice, including cardiovascular health, hypertension management, hyperlipidemia, pediatric care, family medicine, and common illnesses such as influenza and dermatitis.  \n\nThe journal serves as a key resource for evidence-based guidelines, featuring publications like the *Expert Consensus on Mixed Hyperlipidemia in Primary Care* and multiple guidelines on hypertension management, including articles released in April 2019 (Volume 18, Issue 4) and August 2019. It also addresses mental health topics, such as depression treatment, and provides protocols for ASCVD (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) risk assessment.  \n\nRegular issues include the May 2025 edition (Volume 24, Issue 5), which highlights research on general practice medicine. By consolidating clinical research, treatment recommendations, and consensus statements, the journal supports primary care physicians in delivering comprehensive and up-to-date patient care across China.  \n\nIn summary, *中华全科医师杂志* is a leading Chinese medical journal focused on advancing general practice through the dissemination of research, clinical guidelines, and expert consensus on a wide range of health issues relevant to primary care.\",39\r\n869,高血压亚急症,\"**Hypertensive Urgency (高血压亚急症)**  \n\nHypertensive urgency, also known as 高血压亚急症, is a medical condition characterized by a significant elevation in blood pressure without evidence of acute target organ damage. This condition is distinct from hypertensive emergencies, as it does not involve immediate life-threatening complications such as heart failure, stroke, or kidney injury. However, it remains a serious clinical situation that requires prompt medical intervention to prevent progression to more severe complications.  \n\nCommon causes of hypertensive urgency include poor adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications or insufficient treatment regimens. Patients often present with severely elevated blood pressure but lack symptoms of acute organ dysfunction. Management typically involves the use of oral antihypertensive medications to gradually lower blood pressure over hours to days, avoiding rapid reductions that could lead to complications.  \n\nWhile less immediately dangerous than hypertensive emergencies, hypertensive urgency still poses a significant health risk if left untreated. Medical professionals emphasize the importance of timely evaluation and adjustment of therapy to stabilize blood pressure and reduce long-term cardiovascular risks. Close follow-up is recommended to ensure effective control and prevent recurrence.  \n\nIn summary, hypertensive urgency (高血压亚急症) is a clinically important condition marked by severely high blood pressure without acute organ damage, necessitating prompt but controlled treatment with oral medications and careful monitoring to avoid further complications.\",4\r\n670,布地奈德,A nasal corticosteroid spray used for treating allergic rhinitis,2\r\n3546,MECT,\"MECT is a treatment method for patients with severe depression, including those with refusal to eat, suicidal risk, hallucinations, delusions, or tension syndrome, and is considered a first-line treatment option for rapid symptom control.

This condition constitutes a medical emergency, as the rapid rise in blood pressure leads to progressive dysfunction in these organs, necessitating immediate intervention to prevent life-threatening complications.  \n\nThe defining feature of hypertension emergency is not just the high blood pressure itself but the presence of acute organ damage, distinguishing it from less severe hypertensive states. Without prompt treatment, the condition can result in serious consequences, including stroke, heart failure, kidney failure, or other irreversible organ injuries.  \n\nManagement typically involves rapid but controlled blood pressure reduction using intravenous medications in a hospital setting, with close monitoring to avoid complications from overly aggressive treatment. The urgency of addressing hypertension emergency underscores the importance of recognizing its symptoms—such as severe headache, chest pain, visual disturbances, or neurological deficits—and seeking immediate medical care.  \n\nIn summary, hypertension emergency is a dangerous and time-sensitive condition requiring urgent medical attention to mitigate organ damage and stabilize the patient.\",4\r\n3016,国家基本公共卫生服务规范,\"A national standard for public health services in China, referenced for hypertension patient follow-up\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n556,中华全科医师杂志,高血压亚急症,\"The *中华全科医师杂志* (Chinese Journal of General Practitioners) is a medical journal that publishes research articles, guidelines, and clinical recommendations on various aspects of general medicine, including hypertension management.

The article provides clinical insights into effective therapeutic approaches and patient care strategies for such cases.  \n\nAdditionally, the journal is known for disseminating broader guidelines and research on the treatment of *高血压亚急症* (hypertension sub-emergencies), reinforcing its role as a key resource for general practitioners and clinicians dealing with hypertensive crises. By consolidating evidence-based practices and expert recommendations, the journal contributes to standardized care protocols for managing hypertensive urgencies, ensuring better patient outcomes.  \n\nThe descriptions align in emphasizing the journal's focus on hypertension-related conditions, particularly *高血压亚急症*, and its commitment to advancing clinical knowledge through research and guideline publications.
