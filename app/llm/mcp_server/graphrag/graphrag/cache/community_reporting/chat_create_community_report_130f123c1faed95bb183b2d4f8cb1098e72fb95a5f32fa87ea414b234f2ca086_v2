It is a long-acting NSAID, typically administered at a dosage of 250 mg three times daily, and has a half-life of 10–18 hours, which allows for sustained relief.  \n\nThe descriptions provided consistently highlight its primary uses—managing pain and reducing inflammation—as well as its availability without a prescription. The slight variation in phrasing (e.g., \"\"Naproxen is an over-the-counter NSAID\"\" vs. \"\"An over-the-counter NSAID\"\") does not introduce contradictions but rather reinforces the same key points.  \n\nIn summary, 萘普生 is a widely accessible NSAID with prolonged effects due to its extended half-life, making it suitable for managing persistent pain and inflammation. Its dosage and pharmacological properties ensure sustained therapeutic action.\",3\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n580,对乙酰氨基酚,布洛芬,\"对乙酰氨基酚和布洛芬是两种常用的药物，主要用于缓解疼痛和退烧。它们均被推荐作为儿童退烧药，具有相似的疗效和安全性。  \n\n对乙酰氨基酚（也称为扑热息痛）是一种广泛使用的解热镇痛药，适用于轻至中度疼痛（如头痛、牙痛、关节痛）以及发热症状。其作用机制主要通过抑制中枢神经系统中的前列腺素合成，从而发挥镇痛和退热效果。对乙酰氨基酚在儿童和成人中均表现出良好的耐受性，但需注意剂量控制，过量可能导致肝毒性。  \n\n布洛芬则是一种非甾体抗炎药（NSAID），除了镇痛和退热作用外，还具有抗炎效果，适用于炎症相关的疼痛（如肌肉酸痛、关节炎）。其作用机制是通过抑制环氧化酶（COX）来减少前列腺素的生成。布洛芬同样适用于儿童，但可能对胃肠道产生轻微刺激，因此建议在餐后服用以减少不适。  \n\n研究表明，对乙酰氨基酚和布洛芬在退热和镇痛方面的效果相近，且安全性良好，因此在儿科实践中常被交替使用或根据患者个体情况选择。不过，对乙酰氨基酚因其较低的胃肠道副作用，更适合有胃部敏感问题的患者，而布洛芬则因其抗炎特性更适用于伴随炎症的疼痛症状。  \n\n总体而言，这两种药物均为有效且安全的解热镇痛选择，但在使用时需遵循医嘱，注意剂量和禁忌症，以确保最佳疗效和最小副作用。\",12\r\n676,萘普生,痛经,Naproxen is commonly used to relieve menstrual pain,11\r\n674,布洛芬,萘普生,Both are over-the-counter NSAIDs used for pain relief,10\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
