It measures the arterial pressure between heartbeats when the heart is at rest. DBP is a key component in diagnosing hypertension and assessing cardiovascular risk. Diagnostic thresholds for hypertension vary depending on the measurement method: for Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM), a DBP of ≥85 mmHg is considered indicative of hypertension, while specific averages are used for Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM). As a fundamental indicator of cardiovascular health, DBP plays a central role in risk stratification and clinical decision-making. Its measurement is essential for evaluating blood pressure trends and guiding treatment strategies.\",5\r\n1126,SBP,\"**Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)** is the higher number in a blood pressure reading, representing arterial pressure during heart contraction. It is a key metric in blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular health assessment. Diagnostic thresholds for hypertension vary depending on the measurement method: for **Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM)**, a threshold of **≥135 mmHg** is used, while **Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM)** relies on specific averaged values. SBP provides critical insights into cardiovascular function and is widely utilized in clinical and at-home settings to assess and manage hypertension.  \n\nThe two descriptions align in defining SBP as a vital measure of arterial pressure during systole (heart contraction) and emphasize its diagnostic importance.

SBP represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart contracts, while DBP measures the pressure when the heart is at rest between beats. Together, these metrics are essential for assessing cardiovascular health and diagnosing conditions such as hypertension.  \n\nBoth SBP and DBP are critical in evaluating hypertension risk, as elevated levels in either or both can indicate increased strain on the cardiovascular system. Medical professionals rely on these measurements to monitor blood pressure trends, guide treatment decisions, and assess overall heart health. While SBP is often emphasized in hypertension diagnosis due to its stronger association with cardiovascular events, DBP also plays a significant role, particularly in younger individuals or specific clinical contexts.  \n\nIn summary, SBP and DBP are interdependent measures that collectively provide a comprehensive assessment of blood pressure, aiding in the detection, management, and risk stratification of hypertension and related cardiovascular conditions.\",11\r\n948,TIA,SBP,TIA is a clinical condition influenced by high blood pressure (SBP),7\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
