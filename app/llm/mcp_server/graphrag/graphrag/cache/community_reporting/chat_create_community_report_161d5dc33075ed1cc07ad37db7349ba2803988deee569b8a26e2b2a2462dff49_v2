It functions by transporting cholesterol and other lipids from the bloodstream and peripheral tissues to the liver for breakdown and excretion, thereby helping to remove excess cholesterol and prevent its accumulation in arterial walls. This process reduces the risk of atherosclerosis (the buildup of plaque in arteries) and coronary heart disease, earning HDL its reputation as a \"\"scavenger\"\" in the vascular system.  \n\nElevated levels of HDL are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases, while reduced levels indicate an increased susceptibility to conditions such as coronary heart disease. Lifestyle factors such as smoking negatively correlate with HDL levels, whereas regular exercise, smoking cessation, and weight loss can help increase HDL concentrations.  \n\nAlthough HDL is primarily recognized as a beneficial lipid component, one description inaccurately refers to it as a \"\"drug for treating coronary heart disease.\"\" HDL itself is not a medication but a naturally occurring lipoprotein. However, therapies aimed at raising HDL levels or mimicking its functions are areas of research for improving cardiovascular health.  \n\nIn summary, 高密度脂蛋白 (HDL) is a protective lipoprotein that aids in cholesterol clearance, supports arterial health, and reduces the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. Maintaining healthy HDL levels through lifestyle modifications remains a key strategy in cardiovascular disease prevention.\",13\r\n991,Β 受体阻滞剂,\"Beta-blockers (β 受体阻滞剂) are a class of medications primarily used to manage cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension. However, they have notable effects on lipid metabolism, which may impact patients with preexisting lipid abnormalities. These drugs can lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, making them unsuitable for individuals with isolated low HDL and hypertension. Additionally, β 受体阻滞剂 may cause a slight increase in overall lipid levels, potentially exacerbating conditions like hyperlipidemia and reducing treatment efficacy in affected patients.  \n\nWhen prescribing β 受体阻滞剂, healthcare providers should consider the patient's lipid profile, as the medication could worsen lipid-related health issues. While effective for cardiovascular management, its dual impact on HDL reduction and potential lipid elevation necessitates careful evaluation, particularly in patients with concurrent hypertension and dyslipidemia.\",3\r\n2299,长寿综合征,\"长寿综合征是指高密度脂蛋白水平显著升高的现象，与较低的冠心病发生率和较长寿命相关\"\"\",1\r\n2314,血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂,Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂) are drugs that do not affect HDL levels and are recommended for patients with isolated low HDL levels and hypertension.,1\r\n2315,长效钙拮抗剂,Long-acting calcium antagonists (长效钙拮抗剂) are drugs that do not affect HDL levels and are recommended for patients with isolated low HDL levels and hypertension.,1\r\n1022,他汀类药物,,8\r\n2346,心血管疾病,,2\r\n2452,鱼油,\"**鱼油** is a product derived from fish, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which are known for their potential health benefits. Research indicates that these fatty acids may help reduce high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, contributing to improved cardiovascular health. Additionally, epidemiological studies have observed a correlation between high fish consumption—and consequently, higher intake of 鱼油—and lower rates of cardiovascular disease among populations such as Eskimos in Greenland, as well as fishermen in Japan and the Netherlands. These findings suggest that regular consumption of 鱼油, as part of a diet rich in fish, may play a role in promoting heart health and reducing the risk of cardiovascular conditions.  \n\nThe combined evidence highlights 鱼油 as a valuable dietary supplement with potential benefits for lipid metabolism and cardiovascular protection. However, further research is needed to fully understand its mechanisms and optimal usage. The description remains consistent, as the reduction of HDL (often referred to as \"\"good cholesterol\"\") may be context-dependent, with some studies focusing on its role in overall lipid balance rather than absolute reduction.\",8\r\n2455,日本,\"Japan is a country known for its unique cultural and dietary practices that contribute to notable health outcomes. One key aspect is the high consumption of fish among its population, particularly by fishermen, which has been linked to lower rates of heart disease. This dietary habit, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, is often cited as a contributing factor to cardiovascular health. Additionally, research from the International Consortium of Psychiatric Epidemiology (ICPE) indicates that Japan has a low lifetime prevalence of depression compared to many other nations. While the exact reasons for this are multifaceted, potential factors include dietary influences, social cohesion, and cultural attitudes toward mental health. Together, these observations highlight Japan as a country with distinct health advantages, possibly tied to its traditional lifestyle and dietary patterns.\",2\r\n2454,格陵兰岛,\"格陵兰岛 is where Eskimos live, known for low cardiovascular disease rates due to high fish consumption\",1\r\n2456,荷兰,荷兰 is a country where fishermen have low rates of heart disease due to high fish consumption,1\r\n2495,台湾辅仁大学,台湾辅仁大学 conducted a study on the effects of fish oil on patients with high blood lipids,1\r\n2313,烟酸,\"**烟酸（Nicotinic Acid）** 是一种水溶性维生素B3，同时也是一种烟酸类药物，主要用于调节血脂和治疗脂质代谢异常相关疾病。它具有广谱的调血脂作用，能够有效降低总胆固醇（TC）、甘油三酯（TG）、低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL-C）和极低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（VLDL-C）水平，同时提高高密度脂蛋白胆固醇（HDL-C）水平。  \n\n烟酸适用于多种血脂异常病症，包括轻至中度高胆固醇血症、混合型高脂血症、高三酰甘油血症，以及冠状动脉粥样硬化性心脏病（冠心病）伴低HDL水平的患者。其推荐剂量通常为**1-2克**（具体剂量可能因患者情况而异）。  \n\n作为药物，烟酸不仅具有调节血脂的功能，还因其维生素特性而参与体内代谢过程。其双重作用机制使其成为临床治疗血脂异常的重要选择之一。烟酸的药理作用明确，既能改善血脂谱，又对心血管疾病高危患者具有潜在益处。  \n\n综上，烟酸是一种兼具维生素和药物特性的复合分子，广泛应用于血脂异常及相关心血管疾病的治疗与管理。\",3\r\n2590,环孢菌素,环孢菌素是一种用于治疗高胆固醇血症的药物,1\r\n857,利尿剂,\"利尿剂（Diuretics）是一类用于帮助降低血压的药物，其主要作用是通过促进肾脏排出体内多余的盐分和水分来减轻体液潴留，从而减少心脏负担并改善血压控制。这类药物在高血压、心力衰竭等疾病的治疗中广泛应用。  \n\n然而，利尿剂也可能对血脂代谢产生轻微影响，可能导致血脂水平（如胆固醇或甘油三酯）的轻度升高。对于已经存在高血脂症的患者，利尿剂的使用可能加重其病情，并可能降低整体治疗效果。因此，在临床应用中，医生需权衡其降压益处与潜在的血脂影响，必要时结合其他药物或调整治疗方案以优化患者预后。  \n\n综上所述，利尿剂是一种有效的降压药物，但在特定情况下可能对血脂产生不利影响，需在医生指导下合理使用。\",3\r\n858,Β-受体阻滞剂,\"Beta-Blockers, a class of drugs that reduce blood pressure by blocking the effects of adrenaline\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1561,高密度脂蛋白,冠心病,高密度脂蛋白（HDL）与冠心病之间存在密切关联。多项研究表明，高密度脂蛋白水平过低或减少会显著增加患冠心病的风险，提示其可能是冠心病的重要预警指标之一。同时，高密度脂蛋白也被用于冠心病的治疗，且效果显著，这可能与其在脂质代谢和血管保护中的作用有关。因此，高密度脂蛋白不仅可作为冠心病风险的生物标志物，还可能成为治疗该疾病的有效手段之一。,40\r\n644,阿托伐他汀钙,Β 受体阻滞剂,阿托伐他汀钙与β 受体阻滞剂在治疗高血压合并高血脂患者时可能有不同的效果,15\r\n1686,高密度脂蛋白,长寿综合征,高密度脂蛋白水平升高与长寿综合征相关,14\r\n1720,高密度脂蛋白,血管紧张素转换酶抑制剂,Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors do not affect HDL levels and are recommended for patients with isolated low HDL levels and hypertension.,14\r\n1721,高密度脂蛋白,长效钙拮抗剂,Long-acting calcium antagonists do not affect HDL levels and are recommended for patients with isolated low HDL levels and hypertension.,14\r\n1783,他汀类药物,心血管疾病,他汀类药物对防治心血管疾病意义重大,10\r\n1885,鱼油,心血管疾病,鱼油 is linked to low cardiovascular disease rates among certain populations,10\r\n1887,鱼油,日本,\"Fishermen in Japan consume high amounts of fish oil, leading to low heart disease rates\",10\r\n1886,鱼油,格陵兰岛,\"Eskimos in Greenland consume high amounts of fish oil, leading to low cardiovascular disease rates\",9\r\n1888,鱼油,荷兰,\"Fishermen in the Netherlands consume high amounts of fish oil, leading to low heart disease rates\",9\r\n1927,台湾辅仁大学,鱼油,台湾辅仁大学 studied the effects of fish oil on patients with high blood lipids,9\r\n1999,烟酸,胆酸螯合剂,胆酸螯合剂和烟酸可以联用治疗难治的严重高胆固醇血症。,9\r\n2006,他汀类药物,环孢菌素,环孢菌素和他汀类药物都是用于治疗高胆固醇血症的药物,9\r\n547,利尿剂,Β-受体阻滞剂,Both Diuretics and Beta-Blockers are classes of drugs used for treating hypertension,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
