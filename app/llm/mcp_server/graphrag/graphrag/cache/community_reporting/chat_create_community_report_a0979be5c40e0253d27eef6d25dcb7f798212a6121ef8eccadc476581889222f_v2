It measures the arterial pressure between heartbeats when the heart is at rest. DBP is a key component in diagnosing hypertension and assessing cardiovascular risk. Diagnostic thresholds for hypertension vary depending on the measurement method: for Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM), a DBP of ≥85 mmHg is considered indicative of hypertension, while specific averages are used for Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM). As a fundamental indicator of cardiovascular health, DBP plays a central role in risk stratification and clinical decision-making. Its measurement is essential for evaluating blood pressure trends and guiding treatment strategies.\",5\r\n1121,ABPM,\"**ABPM (Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring)** is a clinically validated method for monitoring blood pressure outside of a medical setting. It utilizes internationally certified ambulatory blood pressure monitors that undergo regular calibration to ensure accuracy. ABPM is particularly useful for diagnosing conditions such as white-coat hypertension (elevated blood pressure in clinical settings), masked hypertension (normal blood pressure in clinics but elevated elsewhere), and nocturnal hypertension (abnormally high blood pressure during sleep).  \n\nThe monitoring process involves taking measurements at regular intervals—typically every 15-20 minutes during waking hours and every 30 minutes during sleep. To ensure reliability, valid readings must cover at least 80% of the total monitoring duration, with a minimum of 20 daytime readings and 7 nighttime readings. ABPM provides comprehensive data, including average systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure values over a 24-hour period, as well as separate averages for daytime (awake) and nighttime (sleep) periods.  \n\nBy offering continuous, real-world blood pressure assessment, ABPM helps clinicians make more accurate diagnoses and tailor treatment plans for patients with hypertension-related conditions. Its ability to capture fluctuations over a full day makes it a valuable tool in cardiovascular health management.\",7\r\n1122,HBPM,\"**Summary of HBPM (Home Blood Pressure Monitoring):**  \n\nHBPM (Home Blood Pressure Monitoring) is a widely used method for monitoring blood pressure, particularly in hypertensive patients. It serves multiple purposes, including identifying conditions such as white coat hypertension, masked hypertension, and resistant hypertension, as well as evaluating long-term blood pressure variability, assessing the efficacy of antihypertensive treatments, and predicting cardiovascular risk and prognosis. The diagnostic threshold for hypertension via HBPM is an average systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥135 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥85 mmHg.  \n\nHBPM can be performed by patients themselves or with the assistance of family members, making it a flexible and accessible tool for self-measured or home-based blood pressure assessment. It plays a significant role in enhancing patient health awareness, improving treatment adherence, and facilitating long-term blood pressure management. Additionally, HBPM is recognized as both a self-management tool for patients and an auxiliary diagnostic method for hypertension.  \n\nWith advancements in telemetry technology, internet-based remote HBPM and management systems are emerging as potential future models for blood pressure control. However, further research is needed to validate their effectiveness and health economic benefits. Despite its advantages, improper use of self-monitoring devices—including wearables—may lead to excessive focus on blood pressure, frequent measurements, and fluctuations, which could negatively impact patient well-being.  \n\nIn summary, HBPM is a valuable tool for general hypertension monitoring, offering diagnostic, prognostic, and self-management benefits while requiring proper implementation to maximize its advantages.\",13\r\n1125,家庭血压监测,Chinese term for HBPM (Home Blood Pressure Monitoring),1\r\n1128,MASKED HYPERTENSION,\"A condition where a patient's blood pressure is normal in clinical settings but elevated elsewhere, detectable via HBPM\",1\r\n1130,BLOOD PRESSURE REMOTE MONITORING,Emerging technology for internet-based home blood pressure tracking mentioned in HBPM context,1\r\n1131,WEARABLE BLOOD PRESSURE DEVICES,Technology referenced in HBPM discussion that may cause excessive monitoring if misused,1\r\n1126,SBP,\"**Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)** is the higher number in a blood pressure reading, representing arterial pressure during heart contraction. It is a key metric in blood pressure monitoring and cardiovascular health assessment. Diagnostic thresholds for hypertension vary depending on the measurement method: for **Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM)**, a threshold of **≥135 mmHg** is used, while **Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM)** relies on specific averaged values. SBP provides critical insights into cardiovascular function and is widely utilized in clinical and at-home settings to assess and manage hypertension.  \n\nThe two descriptions align in defining SBP as a vital measure of arterial pressure during systole (heart contraction) and emphasize its diagnostic importance. The first description adds context regarding hypertension thresholds, while the second clarifies its role in a standard blood pressure reading. Together, they form a cohesive summary of SBP’s physiological significance and clinical application.\",6\r\n1132,WHITE COAT HYPERTENSION,,3\r\n1129,RESISTANT HYPERTENSION,\"**Resistant Hypertension** is a medical condition characterized by persistently high blood pressure that remains uncontrolled despite the use of optimal therapeutic strategies. Specifically, it is defined as hypertension that does not respond to treatment with three antihypertensive medications, one of which must be a diuretic, administered at optimal doses. This condition can be identified through home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) or clinical measurements, confirming the lack of control despite adherence to the prescribed regimen.  \n\nThe two provided descriptions align in their core definition but offer slightly different nuances. The first emphasizes the requirement for a diuretic as part of the three-drug regimen, while the second highlights the role of HBPM in detecting uncontrolled blood pressure. Combining these, resistant hypertension is best described as blood pressure that remains elevated despite the concurrent use of three antihypertensive drugs (including a diuretic) at appropriate doses, with confirmation through either clinical or home-based monitoring.  \n\nThis condition often necessitates further diagnostic evaluation to rule out secondary causes of hypertension, assess medication adherence, and consider additional or alternative treatment strategies. Resistant hypertension poses significant cardiovascular risks, making accurate diagnosis and management critical for patient outcomes.\",6\r\n1119,SECONDARY HYPERTENSION,\"**SECONDARY HYPERTENSION** is a form of high blood pressure that arises as a direct result of an identifiable underlying medical condition. Unlike primary hypertension, which has no single clear cause, secondary hypertension is attributable to specific disorders, such as renal disease (e.g., kidney dysfunction) or hormonal imbalances (e.g., hyperaldosteronism or Cushing's syndrome). This type of hypertension often requires thorough screening, particularly in cases where blood pressure remains resistant to standard treatments. Identifying and addressing the root cause—such as treating the underlying renal or endocrine disorder—is essential for effective management. Secondary hypertension underscores the importance of diagnostic evaluation in patients with persistent or unusually severe hypertension to rule out contributing medical conditions.\",3\r\n1199,THIAZIDE DIURETIC,\"**Thiazide Diuretics** are a class of medications primarily used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) by reducing fluid volume in the body. They function as diuretics, promoting the excretion of excess water and sodium through the kidneys, which helps lower blood pressure. Thiazide diuretics are often prescribed as part of combination therapy for resistant hypertension, particularly in cases where other antihypertensive medications alone are insufficient. Their effectiveness in managing hypertension has made them a cornerstone in cardiovascular treatment regimens. By addressing fluid retention and reducing vascular resistance, thiazide diuretics contribute to improved blood pressure control and overall cardiovascular health.\",3\r\n1124,动态血压监测,Chinese term for ABPM (Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring),1\r\n1153,TIA,\"TIA refers to transient ischemic attack, a clinical condition related to hypertension\"\"\",1\r\n2064,SECONDARY HOSPITAL,\"Higher-level medical facilities where complex hypertension and lipid disorder cases are referred\"\"\",2\r\n2063,COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICE,\"Local healthcare providers responsible for initial hypertension and lipid disorder screening and management\"\"\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n994,DBP,高血压,Elevated DBP is a key diagnostic criterion for hypertension,52\r\n919,ABPM,HBPM,\"**Summary of ABPM and HBPM**  \n\nABPM (Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring) and HBPM (Home Blood Pressure Monitoring) are two methods used to measure and monitor blood pressure outside of a clinical setting. Both techniques serve as valuable tools for assessing blood pressure in real-world environments, providing more comprehensive data than single clinic readings.  \n\nABPM involves wearing a portable device that automatically records blood pressure at regular intervals over a 24-hour period, offering insights into fluctuations throughout daily activities and sleep. HBPM, on the other hand, relies on patients measuring their own blood pressure at home using a validated device, typically following a structured schedule.  \n\nThese methods are commonly employed to confirm diagnoses such as resistant hypertension, where blood pressure remains elevated despite treatment. Additionally, they help detect white-coat hypertension (elevated readings in clinical settings only) and masked hypertension (normal readings in clinics but elevated elsewhere). By providing a more accurate representation of a patient's blood pressure patterns, ABPM and HBPM assist healthcare providers in making informed treatment decisions.  \n\nWhile the descriptions provided are largely consistent, they collectively emphasize that both ABPM and HBPM serve the dual purpose of **confirming hypertension diagnoses** and **ongoing blood pressure monitoring** outside the clinic. The repeated mention of their role in non-clinical settings underscores their importance in improving diagnostic accuracy and long-term management of hypertension.  \n\nIn summary, ABPM and HBPM are complementary techniques that enhance blood pressure assessment by capturing real-world measurements, aiding in both diagnosis and continuous monitoring for better patient care.\",20\r\n922,HBPM,家庭血压监测,家庭血压监测 is the Chinese term for HBPM,14\r\n928,HBPM,MASKED HYPERTENSION,HBPM is used to diagnose masked hypertension by comparing clinical vs. home measurements,14\r\n930,HBPM,BLOOD PRESSURE REMOTE MONITORING,Remote monitoring represents an advanced evolution of traditional HBPM methods,14\r\n931,HBPM,WEARABLE BLOOD PRESSURE DEVICES,Wearables represent a technological extension of HBPM capabilities,14\r\n949,SBP,DBP,\"**Summary of SBP and DBP:**  \n\nSystolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) are the two primary components that constitute a blood pressure reading. SBP represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart contracts, while DBP measures the pressure when the heart is at rest between beats. Together, these metrics are essential for assessing cardiovascular health and diagnosing conditions such as hypertension.  \n\nBoth SBP and DBP are critical in evaluating hypertension risk, as elevated levels in either or both can indicate increased strain on the cardiovascular system. Medical professionals rely on these measurements to monitor blood pressure trends, guide treatment decisions, and assess overall heart health. While SBP is often emphasized in hypertension diagnosis due to its stronger association with cardiovascular events, DBP also plays a significant role, particularly in younger individuals or specific clinical contexts.  \n\nIn summary, SBP and DBP are interdependent measures that collectively provide a comprehensive assessment of blood pressure, aiding in the detection, management, and risk stratification of hypertension and related cardiovascular conditions.\",11\r\n1004,WHITE COAT HYPERTENSION,RESISTANT HYPERTENSION,White coat hypertension must be ruled out when diagnosing resistant hypertension,9\r\n1005,SECONDARY HYPERTENSION,RESISTANT HYPERTENSION,Secondary hypertension screening is recommended when resistant hypertension is suspected,9\r\n4593,THIAZIDE DIURETIC,RESISTANT HYPERTENSION,Thiazide diuretics are a required component of therapy for resistant hypertension,9\r\n4594,RESISTANT HYPERTENSION,SECONDARY HYPERTENSION,Resistant hypertension may indicate underlying secondary hypertension,9\r\n920,ABPM,动态血压监测,动态血压监测 is the Chinese term for ABPM,8\r\n948,TIA,SBP,TIA is a clinical condition influenced by high blood pressure (SBP),7\r\n1732,SECONDARY HOSPITAL,FAMILIAL HYPERLIPIDEMIA,Cases of suspected familial hyperlipidemia require referral to secondary hospitals for confirmation,5\r\n1730,COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICE,SECONDARY HOSPITAL,Community health services refer complex cases to secondary hospitals following established transfer protocols,4\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
