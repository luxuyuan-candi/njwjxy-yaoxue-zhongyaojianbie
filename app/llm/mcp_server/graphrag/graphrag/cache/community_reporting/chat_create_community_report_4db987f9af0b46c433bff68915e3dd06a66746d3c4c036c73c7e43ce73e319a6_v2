They include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). These medications are often combined with other drugs to enhance efficacy and minimize side effects.  \n\nRAS inhibitors are particularly beneficial for high-risk hypertensive patients with conditions such as left atrial enlargement, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), or reduced cardiac function, as they may help reduce the occurrence of atrial fibrillation. Additionally, they are used in managing connective tissue disease (CTD)-related hypertension and have been shown to improve endothelial function and inflammation markers.  \n\nOverall, RAS inhibitors play a critical role in cardiovascular disease management, offering therapeutic benefits beyond blood pressure control, including potential protective effects on heart structure and function.\",9\n891,HEART FAILURE,\"**Heart Failure** is a chronic cardiovascular condition characterized by the heart's inability to pump blood effectively to meet the body's needs. It is closely linked to hypertension, with long-term high blood pressure contributing to its development, particularly through complications such as left ventricular hypertrophy. Heart failure is also a potential complication of aortic stenosis due to increased cardiac workload.  \n\nThe condition is classified into subtypes, including **heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF)** and **heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)**. Treatment strategies vary depending on the subtype but commonly include medications such as **angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)**, **angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)**, **angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs)**, and **mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)**, particularly for HFrEF. These therapies aim to improve outcomes and reduce mortality.  \n\nHeart failure has a rising prevalence in China and globally, with its risk significantly influenced by blood pressure levels. Proactive blood pressure management can help lower the likelihood of developing this condition. Overall, heart failure remains a major medical concern due to its chronic nature, association with hypertension, and the need for targeted pharmacological interventions.\",10\n1861,CTD,\"CTD is a connective tissue disease that requires early diagnosis and effective treatment to improve prognosis.
