This condition is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, particularly atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. While often asymptomatic in its early stages, untreated hyperlipidemia can lead to serious health complications.  \n\nSpecific thresholds for cholesterol and LDL levels are used to assess an individual's risk of developing cardiovascular disease. High lipid levels contribute to the buildup of plaque in the arteries (atherosclerosis), narrowing blood vessels and increasing the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes. Management typically involves lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes and increased physical activity, along with medications like statins when necessary. Early detection and intervention are crucial to mitigating long-term risks.\",7\r\n3440,SIMVASTATIN,\"**Simvastatin** is a medication primarily used to treat high cholesterol and mixed hyperlipidemia. It is marketed under brand names such as **Zocor** and **舒降之**. As a **lipophilic statin**, simvastatin works by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme involved in cholesterol production in the liver. It is metabolized by the **CYP3A4** enzyme, which plays a key role in its pharmacokinetics and potential drug interactions.  \n\nSimvastatin helps lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, contributing to improved cardiovascular health. Its lipophilic nature allows it to penetrate cell membranes effectively, enhancing its therapeutic action. However, due to its metabolism via CYP3A4, caution is advised when co-administered with CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., certain antibiotics, antifungals, or grapefruit juice), as this may increase the risk of adverse effects such as myopathy or liver toxicity.  \n\nIn summary, simvastatin is a widely used statin for managing dyslipidemia, available under multiple brand names, with its efficacy and safety influenced by its lipophilic properties and CYP3A4-dependent metabolism.\",11\r\n3499,CEREBRAL THROMBOSIS,\"A type of stroke caused by blood clots in brain vessels, linked to lipid disorders\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n3338,HIGH LIPID LEVELS,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,High lipid levels are a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases,22\r\n3199,SIMVASTATIN,PRAVASTATIN,\"**SIMVASTATIN and PRAVASTATIN** are statin medications primarily used to treat **high lipidemia** (elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels) by lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and improving overall lipid profiles. As members of the statin drug class, they function by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a key role in cholesterol production in the liver.  \n\nBoth medications **require regular liver function monitoring** due to their potential to affect hepatic enzymes, a common consideration for statin therapies. While they share this class-wide safety precaution, they may differ in specific pharmacokinetic properties, such as metabolism and drug interactions, which can influence prescribing decisions.  \n\nIn summary, **SIMVASTATIN and PRAVASTATIN** are effective statins for managing **high lipidemia**, with shared requirements for **liver function monitoring** to ensure patient safety during treatment.
