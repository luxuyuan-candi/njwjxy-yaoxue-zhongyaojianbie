Key drugs in this class include venlafaxine (文拉法辛) and duloxetine (度洛西汀). SNRIs work by inhibiting the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, thereby increasing their levels in the brain to improve mood and emotional regulation.  \n\nWhile effective for mental health conditions, some studies suggest that SNRIs may be associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) during pregnancy. However, further research is needed to fully understand this potential risk.  \n\nOverall, SNRIs are widely recognized as an important pharmacological option for managing depression and anxiety, with venlafaxine and duloxetine being among the most commonly prescribed medications in this class.\",12\n111,NASSA,\"Noradrenergic and Specific Serotonergic Antidepressants - a class of antidepressant medications including mirtazapine\nNoradrenergic and Specific Serotonergic Antidepressants, a class of antidepressants\",4\n113,MAOIS,\"**MAOIs (Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors)** are a traditional and older class of antidepressant medications, which include drugs such as phenelzine and tranylcypromine. As a class of antidepressants, MAOIs work by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. It is important to exercise caution when combining MAOIs with other medications, particularly SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), due to potential interactions that may lead to adverse effects. The need for careful monitoring and dosage adjustments underscores the importance of medical supervision when using MAOIs in treatment regimens.  \n\n(Note: The third description provided was in Chinese, stating that MAOIs require special attention when used in combination with SSRIs, which aligns with the known pharmacological precautions for this drug class.
