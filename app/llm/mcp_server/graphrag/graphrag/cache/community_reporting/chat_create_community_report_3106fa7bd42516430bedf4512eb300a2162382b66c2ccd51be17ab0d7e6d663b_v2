Core symptoms often include emotional, physical, and cognitive disturbances such as fatigue, sleep disruptions, impaired social functioning, and, in severe cases, suicidal thoughts. The condition is classified into mild, moderate, and severe levels based on diagnostic criteria, which also account for additional symptoms like changes in appetite, concentration difficulties, and feelings of worthlessness.  \n\nDepression varies across age, gender, and cultural backgrounds, and its presentation may differ among individuals. While no single diagnostic method exists, standardized clinical evaluation is essential to exclude other medical conditions and confirm the diagnosis. Early diagnosis and evidence-based treatment—including medication, psychotherapy, and lifestyle management—are critical to controlling symptoms and reducing relapse rates.  \n\nDespite its prevalence, depression remains undertreated, with fewer than 10% of affected individuals receiving adequate care in many countries. It is particularly common among patients with physical illnesses, with prevalence rates ranging from 9% to 33%, depending on the underlying condition. Effective treatment of depression not only alleviates mental health symptoms but can also improve physical health outcomes.  \n\nIn summary, depression is a complex, multifaceted disorder requiring comprehensive assessment and tailored interventions to address its wide-ranging impact on emotional well-being, daily functioning, and overall health.\",19\r\n3523,MAINTENANCE PHASE TREATMENT,\"Maintenance phase treatment lasts at least 2-3 years for patients with a high risk of relapse, such as those with multiple recurrences or significant psychosocial stressors.\"\"\",2\r\n3491,5-HT,\"5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a neurotransmitter implicated in the serotonin hypothesis of depression, suggesting its dysfunction plays a role in the disorder.\",1\r\n3492,DA,\"Dopamine (DA) is a neurotransmitter involved in the dopamine system hypothesis of depression, indicating its potential role in the disorder's pathology.\",1\r\n3493,NE,\"Norepinephrine (NE) is a neurotransmitter associated with the norepinephrine system hypothesis of depression, suggesting its dysfunction contributes to the disorder.\",1\r\n3494,HPA,\"The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis is a neuroendocrine system often dysregulated in depression, contributing to the disorder's pathophysiology.\",1\r\n3495,HPT,The Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Thyroid (HPT) axis is another neuroendocrine system that may be involved in the pathology of depression.,1\r\n3503,HYPOTHALAMUS,\"The hypothalamus is a part of the brain that may show metabolic or blood flow abnormalities in depression.\"\"\",1\r\n3504,CEREBELLUM,\"The cerebellum is a part of the brain that may show metabolic or blood flow abnormalities in depression.\"\"\",1\r\n3505,CAUDATE NUCLEUS,\"The caudate nucleus is a part of the brain that may show metabolic or blood flow abnormalities in depression.\"\"\",1\r\n3506,HIPPOCAMPUS,\"The hippocampus is a part of the brain that may show metabolic or blood flow abnormalities in depression.\"\"\",1\r\n3507,AMYGDALA,\"The amygdala is a part of the brain that may show metabolic or blood flow abnormalities in depression.\"\"\",1\r\n3508,LIMBIC SYSTEM,\"The limbic system is a set of brain structures involved in emotion and may show metabolic or blood flow abnormalities in depression.\"\"\",1\r\n3502,CHINESE JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTITIONERS,\"The **Chinese Journal of General Practitioners** is a medical journal dedicated to publishing research articles, clinical guidelines, and other relevant medical content aimed at general practitioners.

The condition's key feature is the cyclical nature of these mood shifts, which can vary in intensity and duration.  \n\nBoth descriptions emphasize the importance of accurate diagnosis and management, as bipolar disorder involves distinct phases that necessitate tailored therapeutic interventions.

Depression is a key component of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by alternating episodes of depression and manic or hypomanic (elevated mood) states. While depression involves persistent sadness, low energy, and loss of interest in activities, bipolar disorder encompasses a broader spectrum of mood swings, including periods of abnormally high energy, impulsivity, or irritability during manic phases.  \n\nIt is critical to differentiate between the two, as depression alone does not include manic or hypomanic episodes, whereas bipolar disorder requires the presence of these elevated mood states for diagnosis. Misdiagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment, as bipolar disorder often requires mood stabilizers rather than antidepressants alone. Both conditions, however, share depressive symptoms, underscoring the importance of thorough clinical evaluation to ensure accurate diagnosis and management.  \n\nIn summary, while depression is a unipolar condition focused solely on low mood, bipolar disorder is a cyclical condition involving both depressive and manic/hypomanic phases.
