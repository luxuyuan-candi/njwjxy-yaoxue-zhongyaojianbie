It is often caused by atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, or vascular blockages, which can result from high cholesterol, high blood lipids (lipidemia), or hypertension. These conditions contribute to the narrowing or occlusion of brain arteries, disrupting oxygen supply and causing severe health complications.  \n\nStroke is associated with a range of physical and psychological consequences, including hemiplegia (paralysis on one side of the body), hand dysfunction, gait abnormalities, and post-stroke depression. These impairments often necessitate rehabilitation, sometimes involving orthoses, to restore mobility and daily living activities. Additionally, research highlights that stroke patients may exhibit lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and dietary modifications can influence risk factors.  \n\nThe condition is a well-documented subject in medical literature, with studies focusing on its epidemiology, prevention, and management strategies. Journals such as *中华神经科杂志 (Chinese Journal of Neurology)* have published research on stroke-related complications like dysphagia and rehabilitation outcomes.  \n\nIn summary, stroke is a serious cardiovascular event with multiple risk factors, primarily linked to high lipid levels, hypertension, and atherosclerosis.
