Elevated TG levels (≥1.7 mmol/L) are a diagnostic criterion for dyslipidemia and are associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), even when low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is well-controlled. TG elevation is often linked to an unhealthy lifestyle, including poor diet and lack of exercise, but can also be influenced by genetic factors.  \n\nTG is monitored alongside other lipid parameters, such as LDL-C and non-HDL-C, particularly in diabetes management, as it contributes to residual cardiovascular risk. While lifestyle modifications—such as improved diet and regular exercise—are primary strategies for managing high TG levels, medications like statins may also be prescribed to reduce elevated triglycerides.  \n\nIn summary, TG is a critical lipid parameter used in dyslipidemia diagnosis, ASCVD risk assessment, and metabolic health evaluation. Its elevation signals potential cardiovascular risk, necessitating lifestyle changes and, in some cases, pharmacological intervention for optimal management.\",15\r\n2982,EPA,\"The **EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid)** is an omega-3 fatty acid that serves as a key component in lipid-lowering treatments. It is particularly utilized to help reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in high-risk patients who have elevated triglyceride levels. By incorporating EPA into therapeutic regimens, clinicians aim to address both lipid abnormalities and cardiovascular risk, making it a valuable agent in managing patients with these conditions. The compound's dual role in lipid modulation and ASCVD risk reduction underscores its importance in cardiovascular health.\",4\r\n3023,IPE,\"**IPE (Icosapent Ethyl)** is a medication primarily used to manage elevated triglyceride levels in patients at high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). It is a highly purified form of ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), a type of omega-3 fatty acid (ω-3脂肪酸类药物), and functions as a lipid-lowering agent.  \n\nAs a prescription drug, IPE is specifically formulated to reduce triglycerides in adults with severe hypertriglyceridemia, particularly when combined with other risk factors for cardiovascular events. Its active component, EPA, contributes to its therapeutic effects by modulating lipid metabolism and reducing inflammation. IPE is distinct from other omega-3 fatty acid formulations due to its high purity and targeted mechanism of action.  \n\nIn clinical practice, IPE is often prescribed alongside statins or other lipid-regulating therapies to further mitigate cardiovascular risk. Its role in improving lipid profiles and potentially reducing ASCVD-related complications has been supported by clinical studies. Overall, IPE serves as a specialized treatment option for patients requiring focused triglyceride management within a broader cardiovascular risk reduction strategy.\",4\r\n3026,DHA,\"DHA is docosahexaenoic acid, a component used in lipid-lowering treatments\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2497,TG,LDL-C,Both TG and LDL-C are lipid parameters monitored and managed in lipid-lowering treatment,55\r\n2487,EPA,TG,Elevated TG (≥2.3 mmol/L) may prompt EPA treatment in high-risk ASCVD patients,19\r\n2544,IPE,EPA,IPE and EPA are both components used in lipid-lowering treatments,8\r\n2545,IPE,DHA,IPE and DHA are both components used in lipid-lowering treatments,6\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
