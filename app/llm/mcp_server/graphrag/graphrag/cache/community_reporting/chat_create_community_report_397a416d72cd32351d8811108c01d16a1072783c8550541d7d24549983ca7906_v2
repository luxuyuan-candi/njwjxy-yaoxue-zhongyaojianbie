These drugs are often used in clinical practice, either as monotherapy or in combination with other treatments, such as statins, when low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets are not achieved. By inhibiting the uptake of cholesterol in the intestines, they help lower overall cholesterol levels in the bloodstream.  \n\nIn addition to their role in managing cholesterol, cholesterol absorption inhibitors can be effectively combined with antihypertensive therapy, making them a versatile option for patients with comorbid conditions, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia. Their mechanism of action complements other lipid-lowering agents, particularly statins, by targeting a different pathway in cholesterol metabolism.  \n\nOverall, cholesterol absorption inhibitors serve as an important therapeutic option for patients requiring additional cholesterol control, especially when statin therapy alone is insufficient. Their ability to integrate with other treatments underscores their utility in comprehensive cardiovascular risk management.\",3\r\n2987,STATINS,\"**Statins** are a class of lipid-lowering drugs primarily used to reduce cholesterol levels by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, a key component in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in the liver. They are considered the first-line treatment for patients with arteriosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, and mixed hyperlipidemia, as well as for high-risk groups to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Statins form the foundation of cholesterol management due to their ability to effectively lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, moderately reduce very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and triglycerides, and slightly increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels.  \n\nIn addition to their lipid-lowering effects, statins help stabilize atherosclerotic plaques and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Commonly prescribed statins include Lovastatin, Simvastatin, Pravastatin, and Atorvastatin. They are often combined with other lipid-lowering agents for enhanced efficacy in treating mixed hyperlipidemia.  \n\nWhile statins are generally well-tolerated, they may pose risks during pregnancy by interfering with fetal development due to their inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. However, they are not known to have significant interactions with antihypertensive medications, making them suitable for patients with concurrent hypertension.  \n\nOverall, statins play a critical role in cholesterol management and cardiovascular risk reduction, with broad clinical applications in both primary and secondary prevention.\",36\r\n3027,CHOLESTEROL ABSORPTION INHIBITORS,A class of drugs used in combination with statins to lower LDL-C levels,1\r\n3258,LDL,\"Low density lipoprotein, the primary cholesterol-carrying lipoprotein that promotes atherosclerosis>\",4\r\n3259,HDL,\"High density lipoprotein, which helps remove cholesterol from tissues and protects against atherosclerosis>\",4\r\n3893,ELDERLY MEN,\"A patient group (60-75 years) requiring either statin or niacin therapy for lipid control\"\"\",1\r\n3928,ACTIVE HEPATITIS PATIENTS,,1\r\n3890,RESINS,\"The only safe lipid-lowering drugs during pregnancy\"\"\",2\r\n770,PREGNANT WOMEN,\"**Pregnant Women**  \n\nPregnant women are recognized as a **key population (重点人群)** in healthcare due to their unique physiological needs and vulnerabilities.

Elevated levels of LDL contribute significantly to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of fatty deposits, or plaques, within arterial walls. As LDL cholesterol accumulates in the arteries, it promotes inflammation and plaque formation, narrowing the blood vessels and increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes.  \n\nThe relationship between LDL and atherosclerosis is well-established, with LDL being a key driver of cholesterol deposition in arterial tissues.
