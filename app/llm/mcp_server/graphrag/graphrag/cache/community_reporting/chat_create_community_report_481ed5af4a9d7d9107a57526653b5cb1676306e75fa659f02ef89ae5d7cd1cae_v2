This condition primarily affects organs such as the heart, kidneys, and brain, which are highly susceptible to the detrimental effects of uncontrolled hypertension.  \n\nIn hypertensive emergencies, severely elevated blood pressure can lead to acute organ damage, posing immediate risks to the affected individual. Over time, chronic hypertension may also cause progressive harm to these organs, impairing their function and increasing the risk of complications such as heart failure, kidney disease, or stroke.  \n\nThe term encompasses both sudden, life-threatening damage and long-term structural or functional deterioration due to sustained high blood pressure. Early detection and management of hypertension are critical in preventing or mitigating 靶器官损害 and its associated health consequences.\",3\r\n1200,高血压急症,\"**Hypertension Emergency (高血压急症)**  \n\nHypertension emergency, or 高血压急症, is a critical medical condition marked by a severe and sudden elevation in blood pressure, accompanied by acute damage to vital target organs such as the heart, brain, and kidneys. This condition constitutes a medical emergency, as the rapid rise in blood pressure leads to progressive dysfunction in these organs, necessitating immediate intervention to prevent life-threatening complications.  \n\nThe defining feature of hypertension emergency is not just the high blood pressure itself but the presence of acute organ damage, distinguishing it from less severe hypertensive states. Without prompt treatment, the condition can result in serious consequences, including stroke, heart failure, kidney failure, or other irreversible organ injuries.  \n\nManagement typically involves rapid but controlled blood pressure reduction using intravenous medications in a hospital setting, with close monitoring to avoid complications from overly aggressive treatment. The urgency of addressing hypertension emergency underscores the importance of recognizing its symptoms—such as severe headache, chest pain, visual disturbances, or neurological deficits—and seeking immediate medical care.  \n\nIn summary, hypertension emergency is a dangerous and time-sensitive condition requiring urgent medical attention to mitigate organ damage and stabilize the patient.\",7\r\n1201,高血压亚急症,\"**Hypertensive Urgency (高血压亚急症)**  \n\nHypertensive urgency, also known as 高血压亚急症, is a medical condition characterized by a significant elevation in blood pressure without evidence of acute target organ damage. This condition is distinct from hypertensive emergencies, as it does not involve immediate life-threatening complications such as heart failure, stroke, or kidney injury. However, it remains a serious clinical situation that requires prompt medical intervention to prevent progression to more severe complications.  \n\nCommon causes of hypertensive urgency include poor adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications or insufficient treatment regimens. Patients often present with severely elevated blood pressure but lack symptoms of acute organ dysfunction. Management typically involves the use of oral antihypertensive medications to gradually lower blood pressure over hours to days, avoiding rapid reductions that could lead to complications.  \n\nWhile less immediately dangerous than hypertensive emergencies, hypertensive urgency still poses a significant health risk if left untreated. Medical professionals emphasize the importance of timely evaluation and adjustment of therapy to stabilize blood pressure and reduce long-term cardiovascular risks. Close follow-up is recommended to ensure effective control and prevent recurrence.  \n\nIn summary, hypertensive urgency (高血压亚急症) is a clinically important condition marked by severely high blood pressure without acute organ damage, necessitating prompt but controlled treatment with oral medications and careful monitoring to avoid further complications.\",5\r\n5185,马宁,\"Ma Ning (马宁) is a mental health expert and corresponding author affiliated with Peking University Sixth Hospital.
