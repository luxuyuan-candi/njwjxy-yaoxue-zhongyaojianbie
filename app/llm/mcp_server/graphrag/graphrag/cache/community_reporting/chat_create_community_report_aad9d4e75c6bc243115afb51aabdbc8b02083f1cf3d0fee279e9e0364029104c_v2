They are also suggested as an **alternative to ACEIs** for patients experiencing side effects like **dry cough**.  \n\nAdditionally, ARBs may offer **benefits beyond blood pressure control**, such as **reducing the risk of mood disorders**, **improving hyperuricemia**, and serving as a **base for combined antihypertensive therapy in diabetic patients with hypertension**. However, they **should not be combined with ACEIs or direct renin inhibitors** due to potential adverse effects like **hyperkalemia and kidney events**.  \n\nPrecautions include **discontinuing ARBs before surgery** to avoid **hypotension (low blood pressure)** and **avoiding use in pregnancy** due to potential risks. Common ARBs include **losartan**, which is also used in pediatric hypertension management.  \n\nIn summary, ARBs are a versatile class of **RAS inhibitors** with broad applications in **cardiovascular and renal protection**, particularly in high-risk populations such as those with **diabetes, obesity, or heart failure**.\",48\n1153,PROTEINURIA,\"**PROTEINURIA** is a medical condition characterized by excessive protein in the urine.
