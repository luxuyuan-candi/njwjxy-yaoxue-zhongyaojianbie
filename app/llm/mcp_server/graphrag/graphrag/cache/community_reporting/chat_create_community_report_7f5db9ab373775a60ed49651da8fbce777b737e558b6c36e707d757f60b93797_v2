It is a key lipid parameter used in assessing cardiovascular risk, particularly in hypertensive patients and those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). LDL-C contributes to the buildup of plaque in arteries, a process known as atherosclerosis, which heightens the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other CVD-related complications.  \n\nAs a primary target for lipid-lowering therapies, LDL-C is central to managing and reducing cardiovascular risk. Various drugs, including statins and other lipid-lowering agents, are designed to lower LDL-C levels in patients with elevated concentrations. Its role in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health makes it a critical focus in both clinical practice and preventive medicine.  \n\nIn summary, LDL-C is a well-established biomarker for cardiovascular risk, a major contributor to arterial plaque formation, and a principal target for therapeutic interventions aimed at improving lipid profiles and reducing CVD morbidity and mortality.\",40\r\n2071,SPC,\"**Summary of SPC (Single-Pill Combination):**  \n\nSPC, or single-pill combination, is a fixed-dose formulation that combines multiple medications into a single pill, primarily used to treat conditions such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. It is designed to simplify treatment regimens by reducing the number of pills a patient needs to take, thereby improving adherence. SPCs typically include antihypertensive and lipid-lowering agents, making them suitable for patients with both high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol levels.  \n\nClinical evidence highlights SPC's dual benefits: it effectively manages hypertension while also addressing hypercholesterolemia, offering a convenient and efficient therapeutic option. Additionally, SPCs are recognized for their relative safety in clinical practice, with no significant adverse effects reported beyond those expected from the individual components.  \n\nWhile the term \"\"SPC\"\" broadly refers to single-pill combinations in pharmacology, the provided descriptions specifically emphasize its role in cardiovascular care, particularly for patients requiring combined antihypertensive and lipid-modifying therapy. The formulations are aligned with treatment protocols aimed at optimizing patient outcomes through simplified dosing.  \n\nIn summary, SPC represents a practical, safe, and effective treatment strategy for managing comorbid hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, leveraging the advantages of fixed-dose combinations to enhance patient compliance and therapeutic efficacy.\",5\r\n2154,NON HDL-C,\"Non HDL-C is a secondary lipid control target for patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia, with specific target values based on patient risk levels\",3\r\n3004,脂必泰,\"Zhibitai, a Chinese herbal compound containing red yeast rice for cholesterol reduction\"\"\",1\r\n4543,SMALL INTERFERING RNA DRUGS,Small interfering RNA drugs are a newer class of medications that target specific genes to lower cholesterol levels>,1\r\n4545,ROSUVASTATIN,A high-intensity statin medication used to lower LDL-C levels>,1\r\n4546,PITAVASTATIN,A moderate-intensity statin medication>,1\r\n4547,XUEZHIKANG,\"**Xuezhikang** is a medical product discussed in the Chinese expert consensus as a traditional Chinese medicine extract primarily used for lipid management.

Xuezhikang's formulation leverages natural extracts to address dyslipidemia, offering a complementary or alternative approach to conventional lipid-lowering therapies.

In contrast, **HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol)**, known as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol, helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream, transporting it to the liver for excretion, thereby reducing cardiovascular risk.  \n\nThese two lipid markers are routinely measured together to provide a comprehensive evaluation of an individual's lipid profile and overall cardiovascular health. While **LDL-C** is associated with higher cardiovascular risk when elevated, **HDL-C** is considered protective, with higher levels generally linked to better outcomes. Their opposing functions make them critical in assessing and managing heart disease risk, guiding interventions such as lifestyle changes or medication to optimize cholesterol levels.  \n\nIn summary, **LDL-C and HDL-C** serve as key indicators in cardiovascular risk assessment, with **LDL-C** promoting harmful plaque formation and **HDL-C** offering protective benefits by aiding cholesterol clearance. Monitoring both markers allows for a balanced understanding of an individual's lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health.\",47\r\n1741,SPC,LDL-C,SPC treatment aims to help most patients achieve LDL-C targets,45\r\n1839,LDL-C,NON HDL-C,\"**Summary of LDL-C and Non-HDL-C as Lipid Control Targets**  \n\nLDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and non-HDL-C (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) are both key lipid control targets for patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia. LDL-C is the primary target for managing lipid levels, with treatment guidelines emphasizing its reduction to mitigate cardiovascular risk. Once LDL-C levels are adequately controlled, non-HDL-C serves as a secondary target, providing a broader measure of atherogenic lipoproteins, including very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and remnant cholesterol.  \n\nThis two-step approach ensures comprehensive lipid management, addressing both LDL-C as the primary focus and non-HDL-C as an additional indicator of residual risk. By prioritizing LDL-C first and then evaluating non-HDL-C, clinicians can optimize treatment strategies for patients with complex lipid disorders.
