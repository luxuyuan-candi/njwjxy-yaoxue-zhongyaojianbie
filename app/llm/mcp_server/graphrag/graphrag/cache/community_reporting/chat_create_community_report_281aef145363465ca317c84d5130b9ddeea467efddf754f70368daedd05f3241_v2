It is administered both orally and intravenously as an antihypertensive drug, including during pregnancy, though it may carry potential side effects such as fetal bradycardia and skin itching. Additionally, labetalol is employed in managing blood pressure in acute ischemic stroke patients prior to treatment.

It is administered intravenously, making it particularly effective in urgent medical scenarios. Nicardipine is indicated for managing high blood pressure in various critical conditions, including acute ischemic stroke patients prior to treatment and pregnant women requiring rapid blood pressure stabilization. As a calcium channel blocker, it works by relaxing blood vessels, thereby reducing vascular resistance and lowering blood pressure. Its intravenous formulation allows for precise and immediate control in acute settings.
