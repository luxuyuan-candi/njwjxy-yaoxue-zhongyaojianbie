Unlike other paragangliomas, HNPGLs are typically non-catecholamine-secreting tumors, meaning they do not produce catecholamines. As a result, they do not require preoperative α-receptor blockers, which are commonly used in the management of most pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs).

Paragangliomas are known to cause hypertension due to their neuroendocrine activity and are frequently associated with underlying genetic mutations.
