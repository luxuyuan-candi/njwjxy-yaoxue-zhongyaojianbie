It is known to metabolize medications such as **R-warfarin**, **clopidogrel**, **omeprazole**, and **esomeprazole**, among others. As a key metabolic enzyme, CYP2C19 contributes to the breakdown and activation of these drugs, influencing their efficacy and safety in clinical use.  \n\nThe enzyme's activity can be affected by inhibitors, which may alter drug metabolism and lead to variations in therapeutic outcomes. While its primary role is in drug metabolism, CYP2C19 is particularly noted for its involvement in the metabolism of **R-warfarin** (as highlighted in multiple descriptions) and antiplatelet/antacid drugs like clopidogrel and proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, esomeprazole).  \n\nThe descriptions confirm CYP2C19's function as a hepatic enzyme with broad metabolic responsibilities, emphasizing its importance in personalized medicine due to genetic polymorphisms that can lead to differential drug responses. No major contradictions exist among the provided descriptions; rather, they collectively reinforce CYP2C19's role in metabolizing multiple clinically significant drugs.  \n\nIn summary, **CYP2C19** is a vital enzyme in drug metabolism, with a well-documented impact on the processing of anticoagulants, antiplatelets, and acid-suppressing medications, making it a key consideration in pharmacogenomics and therapeutic dosing strategies.\",11\r\n5093,格列齐特缓释片,格列齐特缓释片 is an oral hypoglycemic agent metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP2C19,2\r\n5100,苯妥英,苯妥英 is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19,2\r\n859,奥美拉唑,\"**奥美拉唑**（Omeprazole）是一种质子泵抑制剂（OTC/Rx），主要用于抑制胃酸分泌，治疗胃灼热（心烧）和上腹部疼痛等症状。作为胃酸抑制药物，它通过不可逆地阻断胃壁细胞中的H+/K+-ATP酶（质子泵）来减少胃酸的产生，从而缓解与胃酸过多相关的疾病，如胃食管反流病（GERD）和消化性溃疡。  \n\n此外，奥美拉唑在代谢过程中会与细胞色素P450酶系统（尤其是CYP2C19和CYP3A4）相互作用，可能影响其他依赖相同代谢途径的药物的药效。例如，它会与抗血小板药物**氯吡格雷**竞争CYP2C19和CYP3A4的代谢，从而降低氯吡格雷的活性，影响其抗血小板作用。因此，在联合用药时需谨慎评估潜在的药物相互作用风险。  \n\n综上所述，奥美拉唑是一种广泛使用的胃酸抑制药物，但在临床应用中需注意其代谢途径可能对其他药物（如氯吡格雷）的疗效产生影响。\",5\r\n861,法莫替丁,\"An H2 receptor antagonist (OTC) used as an acid-suppressing medication for heartburn and indigestion\"\"\",2\r\n862,雷尼替丁,\"An H2 receptor antagonist (OTC) used to reduce stomach acid production\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n5248,CYP2C19,氯吡格雷,氯吡格雷需经过CYP2C19代谢活化后才能抑制血小板聚集。,22\r\n5464,CYP2C19,格列齐特缓释片,格列齐特缓释片 is metabolized by CYP2C19,13\r\n5469,CYP2C19,苯妥英,苯妥英 induces CYP2C19,13\r\n645,奥美拉唑,法莫替丁,Both are acid-suppressing drugs but work through different mechanisms (PPI vs H2 blocker),7\r\n647,法莫替丁,雷尼替丁,Both are H2 receptor antagonists used for acid suppression,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
