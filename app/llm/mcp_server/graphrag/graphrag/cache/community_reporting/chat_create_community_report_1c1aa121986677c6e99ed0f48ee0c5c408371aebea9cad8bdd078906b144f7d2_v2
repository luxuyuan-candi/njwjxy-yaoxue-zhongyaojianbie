It affects how the body processes food into energy and is associated with a range of serious health complications, particularly cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis. Diabetes often coexists with other metabolic abnormalities, including **hypertension**, **high cholesterol (dyslipidemia)**, and **elevated triglyceride levels**, which collectively increase the risk of **cardiovascular events (ASCVD)**.  \n\nThe condition is frequently linked to **hyperlipidemia**, with type 2 diabetes patients often exhibiting obesity and lipid metabolism disorders. Diabetes can both contribute to and be exacerbated by high lipid levels, creating a cyclical relationship that complicates treatment. It is also a significant **comorbidity** in hypertensive patients, further elevating cardiovascular risk.  \n\nManagement of diabetes requires a multifaceted approach, including **blood pressure control**, **LDL level management**, **dietary adjustments**, **exercise**, and **medication**. The disease is particularly prevalent in elderly populations, often necessitating complex treatment regimens due to its association with multiple metabolic disturbances.  \n\nDiabetes is sometimes referred to as a **\"\"sweet killer\"\"** due to its role in increasing cardiovascular disease incidence. Both **type 1 and type 2 diabetes** significantly raise the likelihood of developing coronary heart disease, with diabetic patients facing a higher overall risk of vascular complications.  \n\nIn summary, diabetes is a **chronic, metabolic disorder** with far-reaching effects on cardiovascular health, frequently intertwined with **hypertension**, **dyslipidemia**, and **obesity**, necessitating comprehensive and proactive management to mitigate its severe complications.\",31\r\n3189,ARTERIOSCLEROSIS,\"**Arteriosclerosis** is a cardiovascular disease characterized by the hardening and narrowing of arteries due to the buildup of plaque, primarily composed of cholesterol, lipids, and other substances. This condition arises when elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), lipoprotein(a), and serum triglycerides contribute to lipid deposition in arterial walls, leading to reduced blood flow and potential blockages. Key factors influencing its development include high cholesterol (hyperlipidemia), untreated long-term hypercholesterolemia, and excessive alcohol intake.  \n\nThe disease is often associated with elevated lipid profile results, particularly high LDL and triglyceride levels, which accelerate plaque formation. Over time, arteriosclerosis can progress to severe complications, such as arterial stiffness and impaired circulation, increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Treatment typically involves statin-based lipid-lowering drugs to manage cholesterol levels and slow disease progression.  \n\nWhile some descriptions emphasize cholesterol as the primary contributor, others highlight the role of triglycerides or alcohol consumption. However, these factors collectively contribute to arterial damage, with cholesterol being the most consistently cited cause. The condition underscores the importance of early lipid management to prevent irreversible arterial hardening.  \n\nIn summary, arteriosclerosis is a multifactorial disease driven by lipid imbalances, leading to arterial plaque buildup, reduced vessel elasticity, and heightened cardiovascular risk. Proactive monitoring of lipid levels and lifestyle modifications are critical in mitigating its progression.\",15\r\n2136,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,,13\r\n2386,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,\"**High Cholesterol** is a common medical condition characterized by elevated levels of lipids in the blood, particularly total cholesterol (TC ≥ 5.2 mmol/L or exceeding 5.72 mmol/L). It is a type of hyperlipidemia and a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and stroke. The condition often occurs in middle-aged and elderly individuals, as well as those with obesity, unhealthy diets, or a family history of hypertension or high cholesterol.  \n\nHigh cholesterol can be classified as primary (genetic) or secondary (caused by underlying diseases or medications). It frequently coexists with hypertension, further increasing the risk of severe complications such as arterial hardening, heart attacks, and strokes. Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is particularly concerning due to its strong association with coronary heart disease.  \n\nManagement of high cholesterol includes dietary therapy, herbal preparations, and lifestyle modifications. It is a primary focus of dietary interventions aimed at reducing lipid levels and mitigating cardiovascular risks. The condition underscores the importance of early detection and preventive care to avoid life-threatening complications.\",38\r\n3312,PRIMARY HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA,,2\r\n1448,GUANGZHOU,\"Guangzhou is a major city in China that has been the focus of several epidemiological and health-related studies.

The city's involvement in diverse health research areas reflects its prominence as a center for scientific and clinical studies.\",2\r\n3307,THYROID FUNCTION DISORDER,\"Thyroid function disorders can lead to secondary high cholesterol.\"\"\",1\r\n3309,SECONDARY HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA,\"Secondary hypercholesterolemia is caused by underlying conditions like thyroid disorders, kidney disease, or diabetes\"\"\",1\r\n3745,PEANUT SHELL,\"Dry peanut shells, 50-10 grams, are decocted in water and taken daily, suitable for high cholesterol patients with spleen deficiency\",1\r\n3747,LIPID-LOWERING AND WEIGHT-LOSS TEA,\"A tea made with cassia seeds and chrysanthemum, 5 grams each, decocted and consumed as a tea, has lipid-lowering, weight-loss, heat-clearing, and liver-pacifying effects\",1\r\n3748,THREE MUSHROOM STIR-FRY,\"A vegetarian dish made with winter mushrooms, mushrooms, and straw mushrooms, stir-fried with corn shoots and seasonings, suitable for high cholesterol patients\",1\r\n3749,SILVER EAR STIR-FRIED WITH PORK,\"A dish made with silver ear fungus and lean pork, stir-fried with seasonings, suitable for high cholesterol patients)<|COMPLETE|>(\"\"entity\"\"\",1\r\n3239,FATTY LIVER,\"**Fatty Liver** is a medical condition characterized by the accumulation of excess fat in the liver. It is often associated with metabolic disturbances, particularly elevated levels of triglycerides (hypertriglyceridemia) and other lipids (hyperlipidemia or high cholesterol). The condition arises due to dysfunction in lipid metabolism, which leads to abnormal fat deposition in liver cells. While fatty liver can be asymptomatic in some individuals, others may experience symptoms such as liver discomfort or tenderness.  \n\nThe descriptions consistently highlight the link between fatty liver and elevated serum lipid levels, including triglycerides and cholesterol. Though the terminology varies slightly—with mentions of \"\"hypertriglyceridemia,\"\" \"\"high lipidemia,\"\" and \"\"high cholesterol\"\"—the underlying association with dyslipidemia remains clear. The condition may develop without noticeable symptoms, making it a silent but potentially progressive disorder if left unmanaged.  \n\nIn summary, fatty liver is primarily driven by metabolic imbalances, particularly involving triglycerides and cholesterol, and can present with or without symptoms. Early detection and management of associated lipid abnormalities are crucial to preventing further liver damage.\",7\r\n2409,HIGH-LIPID BLOOD DISEASE,\"A medical condition characterized by elevated levels of lipids in the blood, which is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.\"\"\",10\r\n276,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,\"**Cardiovascular Diseases** are a group of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels, often linked to high lipid levels (such as cholesterol) and other risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, and hyperuricemia. These diseases are a leading cause of death globally and encompass a wide range of conditions, including coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, angina, myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke, hypertension, and cerebral thrombosis.  \n\nThe primary contributors to cardiovascular diseases include elevated lipid levels, which can lead to plaque buildup in arteries (atherosclerosis), restricting blood flow and increasing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Additional risk factors such as diabetes and hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels) further exacerbate these conditions, with studies indicating that hyperuricemia is an independent risk factor associated with increased mortality in both men and women.  \n\nWhile high cholesterol and lipid imbalances are frequently cited as key causes, cardiovascular diseases can also arise from or be worsened by hypertension, lifestyle factors, and metabolic disorders. The interconnected nature of these conditions underscores the importance of managing risk factors through preventive measures, early detection, and treatment to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular diseases.\",15\r\n275,METABOLIC SYNDROME,\"**METABOLIC SYNDROME** is a cluster of interconnected metabolic conditions that significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by a combination of obesity, hypertension (high blood pressure), dyslipidemia (abnormal cholesterol or triglyceride levels), and insulin resistance, often leading to elevated blood sugar levels. The syndrome is also frequently associated with gout and hyperuricemia (high uric acid levels), as well as elevated triglyceride levels, which further contribute to cardiovascular risks.  \n\nMetabolic syndrome serves as a common underlying cause for multiple health issues, including high cholesterol, diabetes, and related metabolic disorders. The coexistence of these conditions creates a synergistic effect, amplifying the likelihood of developing severe cardiovascular complications. While the exact mechanisms may vary, the syndrome is universally recognized as a significant predictor of long-term health risks, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and lifestyle interventions to mitigate its effects.  \n\nThe descriptions collectively highlight the multifaceted nature of metabolic syndrome, reinforcing its role as a critical health concern tied to both metabolic and cardiovascular dysfunction. By addressing its core components—such as weight management, blood pressure control, and lipid regulation—individuals can reduce their risk of associated complications.\",5\r\n3372,OBESE INDIVIDUALS,,5\r\n3368,UNHEALTHY DIET CONSUMERS,\"People who consume high-fat, high-salt, high-sugar diets are more prone to developing high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\"\"\",2\r\n3369,SMOKERS AND DRINKERS,\"Individuals with tobacco and alcohol habits have increased risk of developing high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\"\"\",2\r\n3370,STRESSED INDIVIDUALS,\"People with high stress levels and irregular lifestyles are more susceptible to high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\"\"\",2\r\n3371,FAMILY HISTORY PATIENTS,\"Individuals with family history of hypertension or high cholesterol have higher risk of developing these conditions.\"\"\",2\r\n3216,PANCREAS,\"The **pancreas** is an organ located behind the stomach, playing a critical role in digestion and metabolic regulation. It becomes most active in secretion after meals, particularly when food reaches the duodenum. As part of its exocrine function, the pancreas releases digestive enzymes, including **lipase**, which aids in the breakdown of fats within the small intestine. This dual role—both in timing its secretions to coincide with food intake and in producing essential enzymes—highlights the pancreas's importance in maintaining efficient digestion and nutrient absorption.  \n\nIn summary, the pancreas is a vital organ positioned posterior to the stomach, responding to food ingestion by secreting enzymes like lipase into the small intestine to facilitate fat digestion. Its activity is closely tied to meal consumption, ensuring optimal digestive function.\",6\r\n2410,LEGUMES,\"Plant-based protein sources recommended for their fiber content in lipid management diets\"\"\",1\r\n2412,FRUITS,\"Food group recommended in controlled portions (200-350g/day) for metabolic health\"\"\",1\r\n2414,LOW-FAT DAIRY,\"Recommended animal protein source for lipid control\"\"\",1\r\n2415,LEAN MEATS,\"Animal protein category specified for reduced fat intake\"\"\",1\r\n3286,DUODENUM,\"Part of the small intestine where food arrives after leaving the stomach, triggering pancreatic secretion>\",1\r\n3294,STOMACH,,1\r\n3830,MEDICAL EXAMINATION,\"A prerequisite health check recommended before obese individuals begin rehabilitation exercises\"\"\",2\r\n3831,REHABILITATION EXERCISE,\"Structured physical activities designed to help obese individuals lose weight and improve health\"\"\",2\r\n3911,NICOTINIC ACID,\"**Nicotinic Acid (Niacin)** is a lipid-modifying drug primarily used as a lipid-lowering agent. It is effective in managing severe hypertriglyceridemia, often in combination with other treatments such as fibrates or ω-3 fatty acids. However, nicotinic acid has notable limitations, particularly in patients with diabetes, as it can worsen glucose tolerance and is therefore not recommended for diabetic individuals.  \n\nIn summary, nicotinic acid serves as a therapeutic option for lipid regulation, particularly in cases of severe hypertriglyceridemia, but its use requires careful consideration of metabolic effects, especially in diabetic patients. The drug’s benefits in lipid management must be weighed against its potential adverse impact on glucose metabolism.\",4\r\n3919,NICOTINIC ACID CLASS,,3\r\n3829,HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE,\"A form of physical activity that leads to greater weight loss but requires gradual adaptation for obese individuals\"\"\",1\r\n4001,GLUCOSE TOLERANCE,\"Glucose tolerance refers to the body's ability to process sugar, which can be affected by certain medications\",2\r\n3854,INOSITOL NICOTINATE,\"**Inositol Nicotinate** is an ester compound composed of one molecule of inositol and six molecules of niacin (vitamin B3). Upon ingestion, it undergoes gradual metabolism in the body, releasing both niacin and inositol over time. This slow-release mechanism contributes to its therapeutic effects, which include improving lipid metabolism and promoting vasodilation.  \n\nPrimarily recognized as a lipid-lowering agent, Inositol Nicotinate is used to manage dyslipidemia by modulating cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Its vasodilatory properties further support cardiovascular health by enhancing blood flow. The combined actions of niacin (known for its lipid-regulating effects) and inositol (a sugar alcohol with potential metabolic benefits) make Inositol Nicotinate a multifaceted compound in supporting circulatory and metabolic functions.  \n\nThe descriptions align in characterizing Inositol Nicotinate as a slow-release niacin derivative with dual benefits for lipid regulation and vascular health, without noted contradictions.\",2\r\n3853,ACIPIMOX,\"**ACIPIMOX**  \n\nAcipimox is a synthetic derivative of nicotinic acid (niacin) belonging to the niacin-class of drugs. It is also known as *Oxylytic Acid* and shares similar therapeutic applications with niacin but exhibits longer-lasting and more potent anti-lipolytic effects. Primarily administered orally, the typical dosage is **0.25 g per dose**, taken **two to three times daily**.  \n\nAcipimox is primarily used to **lower triglyceride and cholesterol levels** in the blood, making it beneficial for managing dyslipidemia. Additionally, it has been shown to **improve glucose tolerance**, which may be advantageous for patients with metabolic disorders. Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting lipolysis, thereby reducing the release of free fatty acids and improving lipid metabolism.  \n\nIn summary, Acipimox is a niacin-derived medication with enhanced efficacy and duration of action, prescribed for its lipid-modifying and glucose-regulating properties. Its oral administration and well-defined dosing regimen make it a practical option for long-term management of hyperlipidemia and related metabolic conditions.\",3\r\n3310,FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA,\"Familial hypercholesterolemia is an inherited form of high cholesterol where family members often have elevated levels\"\"\",2\r\n3912,PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRANICOTINATE,Pentaerythrityl tetranicotinate is mentioned as a lipid-lowering agent,1\r\n3832,CORONARY HEART DISEASE PATIENTS,\"**Summary of Coronary Heart Disease Patients**  \n\nCoronary heart disease (CHD) patients represent a diverse group with varying medical needs and treatment considerations. Among them, a subgroup consists of obese individuals who require specialized medical supervision during exercise due to heightened cardiovascular risks and potential complications. This underscores the importance of tailored exercise regimens to ensure safety and efficacy.  \n\nAdditionally, not all CHD patients are suitable candidates for cholesterol-lowering treatments, as individual factors such as comorbidities, medication tolerance, and disease severity influence treatment decisions. This highlights the necessity of personalized medical assessments to determine the most appropriate therapeutic approaches for each patient.  \n\nIn summary, coronary heart disease patients encompass a spectrum of clinical profiles, including those with obesity requiring monitored physical activity and others for whom cholesterol-lowering therapies may not be advisable. Comprehensive care for CHD patients must account for these variations to optimize outcomes.\",2\r\n3927,LIPID-LOWERING TREATMENT,\"Long-term medical treatment process for managing high cholesterol levels, requiring regular monitoring\",2\r\n3833,HYPERLIPIDEMIA PATIENTS,\"Individuals with high lipid levels who require specific exercise regimens\"\"\",1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n901,DIABETES,HYPERTENSION,\"**Summary of Diabetes and Hypertension:**  \n\nDiabetes mellitus (diabetes) and hypertension are closely interrelated conditions that significantly impact cardiovascular health. Diabetes exacerbates hypertension through metabolic mechanisms, such as insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction, which contribute to elevated blood pressure.  \n\nWhile both conditions are independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), their coexistence multiplicatively increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This synergistic effect underscores the importance of managing both conditions concurrently to mitigate their compounded impact on heart health.  \n\nIn summary, diabetes and hypertension interact through metabolic pathways, worsening each other’s effects, and their co-occurrence substantially heightens the risk of cardiovascular complications. Effective management requires addressing both conditions to reduce overall disease burden.\",111\r\n3078,ARTERIOSCLEROSIS,STROKE,\"**ARTERIOSCLEROSIS and STROKE**  \n\nArteriosclerosis, a condition characterized by the thickening and hardening of the arteries, can have severe consequences when it affects the brain's blood vessels. This narrowing and stiffening of the arteries restrict blood flow, increasing the risk of stroke—a sudden interruption of blood supply to the brain. Research indicates that arteriosclerosis significantly elevates the likelihood of stroke, as it can lead to blockages or ruptures in the affected vessels, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients.  \n\nThe relationship between arteriosclerosis and stroke is well-established, with the former serving as a major contributing factor to the latter. By impairing vascular health, arteriosclerosis creates conditions where strokes are more likely to occur, emphasizing the importance of managing cardiovascular risk factors to prevent both conditions.\",77\r\n2862,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,HIGH LIPIDEMIA,High blood pressure and high lipidemia are both risk factors for cardiovascular diseases,66\r\n2063,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,HIGH TRIGLYCERIDES,Both are types of hyperlipidemia,44\r\n2918,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,PRIMARY HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA,Primary hypercholesterolemia causes high cholesterol levels,40\r\n3332,GUANGZHOU,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,A survey on high cholesterol was conducted in Guangzhou's tertiary hospitals,40\r\n2914,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,THYROID FUNCTION DISORDER,Thyroid function disorders can lead to secondary high cholesterol.,39\r\n2919,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,SECONDARY HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA,Secondary hypercholesterolemia causes high cholesterol levels,39\r\n3718,PEANUT SHELL,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,Peanut shell decoction is used for high cholesterol patients,39\r\n3721,LIPID-LOWERING AND WEIGHT-LOSS TEA,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,The tea is specifically for lowering cholesterol,39\r\n3722,THREE MUSHROOM STIR-FRY,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,The dish is recommended for high cholesterol patients,39\r\n3723,SILVER EAR STIR-FRIED WITH PORK,HIGH CHOLESTEROL,The dish is recommended for high cholesterol patients,39\r\n3013,FATTY LIVER,HYPERLIPIDEMIA,Hyperlipidemia contributes to fatty liver by disrupting lipid metabolism,36\r\n2082,HIGH-LIPID BLOOD DISEASE,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,High lipid levels in the blood are a significant risk factor for developing cardiovascular diseases.,25\r\n227,METABOLIC SYNDROME,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,Metabolic syndrome and hyperuricemia are interconnected risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.,20\r\n3042,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,OBESE INDIVIDUALS,Obesity is a major risk factor for developing high blood pressure.,18\r\n229,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES,\"Both are influenced by hyperuricemia, with cardiovascular diseases increasing the risk of neurological complications like stroke.\",17\r\n3043,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,UNHEALTHY DIET CONSUMERS,Poor dietary habits contribute to development of high blood pressure.,15\r\n3044,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,SMOKERS AND DRINKERS,Tobacco and alcohol use increases risk of high blood pressure.,15\r\n3045,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,STRESSED INDIVIDUALS,Chronic stress contributes to development of high blood pressure.,15\r\n3046,HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,FAMILY HISTORY PATIENTS,Genetic predisposition increases likelihood of developing high blood pressure.,15\r\n2819,PANCREAS,FAMILIAL HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA,Hypertriglyceridemia can lead to acute pancreatitis,12\r\n2087,HIGH-LIPID BLOOD DISEASE,LEGUMES,Suggested as high-fiber food to improve lipid profiles,11\r\n2089,HIGH-LIPID BLOOD DISEASE,FRUITS,Controlled intake recommended for metabolic benefits,11\r\n2090,HIGH-LIPID BLOOD DISEASE,LOW-FAT DAIRY,Recommended as primary animal protein source for lipid management,11\r\n2091,HIGH-LIPID BLOOD DISEASE,LEAN MEATS,Specified as preferred animal protein to limit fat intake,11\r\n2874,PANCREAS,DUODENUM,The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes in response to food reaching the duodenum,7\r\n2876,PANCREAS,STOMACH,The pancreas is located behind the stomach in the abdominal cavity,7\r\n3805,MEDICAL EXAMINATION,OBESE INDIVIDUALS,Obese individuals should undergo medical examination before starting exercises,7\r\n3807,REHABILITATION EXERCISE,OBESE INDIVIDUALS,Obese individuals are the primary recipients of rehabilitation exercise programs,7\r\n3953,NICOTINIC ACID,NICOTINIC ACID CLASS,Nicotinic acid belongs to the nicotinic acid class of lipid-lowering agents,7\r\n3804,HIGH INTENSITY EXERCISE,OBESE INDIVIDUALS,Obese individuals need gradual adaptation to high intensity exercises,6\r\n4091,NICOTINIC ACID,GLUCOSE TOLERANCE,Nicotinic acid can worsen glucose tolerance in diabetic patients,6\r\n3954,INOSITOL NICOTINATE,NICOTINIC ACID CLASS,Inositol nicotinate belongs to the nicotinic acid class of lipid-lowering agents,5\r\n4092,ACIPIMOX,GLUCOSE TOLERANCE,Acipimox can improve glucose tolerance in diabetic patients,5\r\n2928,FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA,PRIMARY HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA,Familial hypercholesterolemia is a type of primary hypercholesterolemia,4\r\n3955,PENTAERYTHRITYL TETRANICOTINATE,NICOTINIC ACID CLASS,Pentaerythrityl tetranicotinate belongs to the nicotinic acid class of lipid-lowering agents,4\r\n3977,CORONARY HEART DISEASE PATIENTS,LIPID-LOWERING TREATMENT,Not all coronary heart disease patients are suitable for lipid-lowering treatment,4\r\n3808,REHABILITATION EXERCISE,HYPERLIPIDEMIA PATIENTS,These patients require sustained exercise programs for treatment,3\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
