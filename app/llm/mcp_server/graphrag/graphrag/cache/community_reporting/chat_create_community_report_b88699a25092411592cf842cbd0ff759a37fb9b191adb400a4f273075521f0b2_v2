This class includes VEGF monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, as well as tyrosine kinase inhibitors like sunitinib, sorafenib, and axitinib. These drugs exert their hypertensive effects through multiple mechanisms, including activation of the RAS pathway, induction of vasoconstriction, increased sensitivity of smooth muscle cells to vasopressin, and elevated blood viscosity.
