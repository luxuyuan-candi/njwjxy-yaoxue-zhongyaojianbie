This process increases the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks, strokes, and other complications. ASCVD is a major public health concern, particularly in China, where it is the leading cause of death among urban and rural residents, accounting for over 40% of fatalities.  \n\nASCVD risk is assessed through stratification methods, categorizing individuals as low, medium, or high risk based on factors like smoking, low HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), age, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. This risk assessment is used to guide clinical decisions, including lipid-lowering treatments such as statins, which are commonly prescribed for prevention and management. Additionally, ASCVD risk stratification helps determine target LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) levels, especially for patients with comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes.  \n\nManagement strategies for ASCVD include lifestyle interventions (e.g., diet, exercise) and medication to control cholesterol levels and other risk factors. Regular lipid monitoring is essential for both prevention and treatment. Apolipoprotein B (ApoB) is also a significant predictor of ASCVD events, further linking dyslipidemia and hypertension to disease progression.  \n\nWhile some descriptions refer to the condition as \"\"Arteriosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease,\"\" the more widely accepted term is **Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD)**, emphasizing the role of plaque buildup in arterial walls.
