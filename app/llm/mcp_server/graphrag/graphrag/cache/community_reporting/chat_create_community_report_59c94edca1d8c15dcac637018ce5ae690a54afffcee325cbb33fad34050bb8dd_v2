It is a leading cause of death globally, particularly in China, where it accounts for over 45% of total deaths.  \n\nThe disease is influenced by multiple risk factors, including high blood pressure (both isolated systolic hypertension [ISH] and increased diastolic pressure [IDH]), elevated cholesterol levels, smoking, and physical inactivity. Hypertension, in particular, is strongly correlated with cardiovascular disease, as elevated systolic pressure increases mortality and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, while IDH is linked to higher risks of cerebral hemorrhage, cardiovascular mortality, and other complications, especially in younger patients.  \n\nLifestyle modifications and medical interventions can mitigate risks. Smoking cessation reduces cardiovascular disease risk, while medications such as SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) have been shown to lower the likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. Effective blood pressure management is also crucial in reducing the incidence and severity of cardiovascular disease.  \n\nOverall, cardiovascular disease represents a major public health challenge, with prevention and treatment strategies focusing on controlling modifiable risk factors and utilizing targeted therapies.\",26\n1053,SMOKING,\"\nSmoking is identified as a risk factor for mortality, cardiovascular disease, and stroke in the Syst-China trial\",3\n910,EGFR (ESTIMATED GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE),\"Measure of kidney function used to assess cardiovascular risk in hypertension\"\"\",1\n911,UACR (URINE ALBUMIN-TO-CREATININE RATIO),\"Marker of kidney damage that predicts cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients\"\"\",1\n1054,QUITTING SMOKING,Quitting smoking reduces cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality risk,2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n741,CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE,HYPERTENSION,\"**Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)** and **Hypertension** are closely interrelated conditions.
