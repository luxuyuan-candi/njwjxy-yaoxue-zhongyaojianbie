This buildup leads to reduced blood flow and increased risk of complications such as blockages. The disease is often associated with elevated lipid levels, including high cholesterol (particularly LDL) and serum triglycerides, which contribute to arterial stiffening and plaque formation.  \n\nArteriosclerosis is frequently diagnosed through lipid profile tests, which may reveal abnormal levels of these lipids. Treatment commonly involves statin-based lipid-lowering drugs to manage cholesterol and slow disease progression. While high cholesterol is a primary cause, other factors such as hypertension, smoking, and diabetes can also contribute to its development.  \n\nThe condition is sometimes conflated with atherosclerosis (a specific type of arteriosclerosis), but it broadly refers to arterial hardening from multiple causes, including lipid imbalances. Descriptions may vary in emphasis—some highlight cholesterol buildup, while others focus on triglyceride elevation—but all agree on the central role of lipid dysfunction and arterial stiffening. The disease requires long-term management to prevent severe cardiovascular events like heart attacks or strokes.  \n\nIn summary, arteriosclerosis is a progressive arterial disease driven by lipid accumulation, leading to vessel hardening and narrowing, with treatment centered on lipid control and risk factor modification.\",11\r\n19,STROKE,\"**STROKE** is a serious medical condition characterized by impaired or interrupted blood flow to the brain, leading to cell death and neurological deficits. It is a cerebrovascular event often caused by atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, or other vascular blockages, which restrict oxygen and nutrient supply to brain tissues. Stroke is strongly associated with high lipid levels (lipidemia), particularly elevated cholesterol, and is frequently linked to hypertension and other cardiovascular risk factors.  \n\nThe condition can result in severe complications, including hemiplegia (paralysis on one side of the body), hand dysfunction, gait abnormalities, and impaired daily living activities, significantly affecting quality of life. Rehabilitation, often involving orthoses and physical therapy, is commonly required to manage these long-term effects.  \n\nStroke is considered a medical emergency, as timely intervention is critical to minimize brain damage. Prevention strategies focus on controlling risk factors such as high blood lipids, hypertension, and poor diet, with dietary modifications playing a key role in reducing incidence. Lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) have been observed in stroke patients, further emphasizing the connection between lipid metabolism and stroke risk.  \n\nEpidemiologically, stroke is recognized as a leading cause of disability and mortality, with research highlighting its association with high lipidemia as one of its \"\"dangerous partners.\"\" Management includes acute treatment, secondary prevention, and long-term rehabilitation to address functional impairments.  \n\nIn summary, stroke is a multifaceted condition with significant neurological consequences, driven primarily by vascular and metabolic factors. Its prevention and treatment require a comprehensive approach targeting underlying causes such as high lipid levels, hypertension, and atherosclerosis.\",24\r\n21,WRIST ORTHOSIS,\"Devices used to support or correct wrist function, often used for patients with weak or paralyzed wrist extensor muscles\"\"\",1\r\n1288,INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE,\"Intracerebral hemorrhage is a type of stroke discussed in the text, with focus on its management and treatment.\"\"\",1\r\n3670,ADL,\"Activities of Daily Living are essential tasks that individuals perform daily, and their recovery is a focus in stroke rehabilitation\",1\r\n3671,MORRIS,\"Morris conducted research on high-intensity progressive resistance training for stroke patients, showing improvements in lower limb strength and motor function\",1\r\n3672,YOU,\"You conducted research on functional electrical stimulation for stroke patients, showing improvements in upper limb function and walking speed\",1\r\n3673,YAMAGUCHI,\"Yamaguchi conducted research on functional electrical stimulation for stroke patients, showing improvements in upper limb function and walking speed\",1\r\n3813,CLINICAL REHABILITATION,\"A journal specializing in rehabilitation research, including outcomes of stroke rehabilitation\"\"\",1\r\n3814,NEUROREHABILITATION,\"A journal focusing on rehabilitation for neurological conditions, including stroke\"\"\",1\r\n3815,BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,\"A multidisciplinary journal publishing research on various medical topics, including stroke\"\"\",1\r\n3816,PM&R (PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION),\"A journal covering physical medicine and rehabilitation, including post-stroke spasticity management\"\"\",1\r\n3817,JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF THAILAND,\"A medical journal publishing research on various health topics, including stroke in Thailand\"\"\",1\r\n3880,CHURCH C,Researcher involved in the study of surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation to the shoulder after acute stroke>,1\r\n3892,THROMBOSIS RESEARCH,A journal that published research on pharmacological prophylaxis for deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in acute ischemic stroke patients,1\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n1649,ARTERIOSCLEROSIS,STROKE,Arteriosclerosis in the brain's arteries can lead to strokes.,35\r\n12,STROKE,HAND ORTHOSIS,Stroke patients often require hand orthoses for rehabilitation,26\r\n13,STROKE,WRIST ORTHOSIS,Stroke patients may need wrist orthoses to support weakened muscles,25\r\n873,STROKE,INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE,Intracerebral hemorrhage is a type of stroke.,25\r\n3077,STROKE,ADL,\"Stroke affects Activities of Daily Living, and rehabilitation focuses on their recovery\",25\r\n3078,STROKE,MORRIS,Morris researched high-intensity progressive resistance training for stroke patients,25\r\n3079,STROKE,YOU,You researched functional electrical stimulation for stroke patients,25\r\n3080,STROKE,YAMAGUCHI,Yamaguchi researched functional electrical stimulation for stroke patients,25\r\n3186,STROKE,CLINICAL REHABILITATION,Clinical Rehabilitation publishes research on stroke rehabilitation outcomes,25\r\n3187,STROKE,NEUROREHABILITATION,NeuroRehabilitation publishes studies on functional electrical stimulation and other rehabilitation methods for stroke patients,25\r\n3188,STROKE,BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,Biomedical Research International publishes research on brain lesion locations and spasticity in stroke patients,25\r\n3189,STROKE,PM&R (PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION),PM&R publishes research on predictors and management of post-stroke spasticity,25\r\n3190,STROKE,JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF THAILAND,The journal published a multicenter study on post-stroke spasticity prevalence and management in Thailand,25\r\n3235,STROKE,CHURCH C,Church C published research in the journal Stroke,25\r\n3241,THROMBOSIS RESEARCH,STROKE,Both journals published research related to stroke and its complications,25\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
