Do not make anything up in your answer.\n\nText:\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\r\n3187,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,\"**Atherosclerosis** is a chronic cardiovascular disease characterized by the progressive buildup of fatty deposits, cholesterol, and plaques within the arterial walls. This accumulation leads to the hardening and narrowing of arteries, reducing blood flow and increasing the risk of serious complications such as coronary heart disease, heart attacks, and strokes. The condition is primarily driven by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and other lipids in the blood, a state known as hyperlipidemia. However, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or \"\"good\"\" cholesterol, may help mitigate its progression.  \n\nThe disease develops when lipids, including cholesterol, accumulate in the artery walls, forming plaques that can restrict blood flow or rupture, triggering clot formation. Over time, these changes contribute to arterial stiffness and blockages, impairing oxygen and nutrient delivery to vital organs. Risk factors include high cholesterol, particularly elevated LDL levels, as well as other metabolic and lifestyle influences.  \n\nWhile the descriptions vary slightly in phrasing, they consistently emphasize atherosclerosis as a lipid-driven process that results in arterial plaque buildup, vascular narrowing, and heightened cardiovascular risk. The condition is both preventable and manageable through lifestyle modifications, lipid-lowering therapies, and monitoring of cholesterol levels.\",33\r\n3208,LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"**Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)** is a type of lipoprotein responsible for transporting cholesterol into surrounding tissues, including blood vessels. It accounts for approximately 75% of total cholesterol in the body. LDL plays a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of arterial plaques. When LDL levels are elevated, it deposits cholesterol in the walls of arteries, contributing to plaque formation and narrowing of the blood vessels. This process increases the risk of coronary heart disease and other cardiovascular complications. Due to its role in cholesterol transport and plaque accumulation, LDL is often referred to as \"\"bad cholesterol.\"\" Elevated LDL levels are strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, making it a critical biomarker in cardiovascular health assessments.\",10\r\n3209,HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,\"**High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)**, commonly referred to as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol, is a vital component of lipid metabolism with significant benefits for cardiovascular health. HDL accounts for approximately 25% of total cholesterol in the body and plays a crucial role in transporting excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver for processing and excretion, a process known as reverse cholesterol transport. This mechanism helps prevent the buildup of cholesterol in arterial walls, thereby reducing the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease.  \n\nHDL is widely recognized for its protective effects on the cardiovascular system. Low levels of HDL are associated with a higher incidence of coronary heart disease, while elevated levels are linked to improved heart health. HDL also activates key enzymes involved in lipoprotein metabolism, further aiding in cholesterol clearance.  \n\nThe measurement of HDL levels is typically expressed in millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Lifestyle factors, such as regular exercise, can increase HDL concentrations, enhancing its cardioprotective benefits. Due to its role in reducing cardiovascular risk, maintaining healthy HDL levels is an important aspect of preventive healthcare.  \n\nIn summary, High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is a beneficial form of cholesterol that supports cardiovascular health by facilitating cholesterol removal, preventing arterial plaque formation, and lowering the risk of heart disease. Its levels can be improved through physical activity, underscoring the importance of lifestyle in maintaining optimal HDL function.\",10\r\n3426,FOAM CELLS,\"Foam cells are lipid-laden macrophages that form during the development of atherosclerotic plaques.\"\"\",1\r\n3428,SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS,\"Smooth muscle cells in arterial walls can be stimulated by high lipid concentrations to release growth factors contributing to atherosclerosis\"\"\",1\r\n3429,MACROPHAGES,\"Macrophages in arterial walls can be stimulated by high lipid concentrations to release growth factors contributing to atherosclerosis\"\"\",1\r\n3430,PLATELETS,\"Platelets can be activated by high lipid concentrations, releasing growth factors that contribute to arterial wall thickening\"\"\",1\r\n3493,ARTERY,\"Arteries are blood vessels that can become narrowed or blocked by atherosclerotic plaques, leading to cardiovascular events\",1\r\n3495,BLOOD VESSEL,Blood vessels transport blood throughout the body and can develop atherosclerotic plaques,1\r\n3475,TAIWAN MAKAY,\"Taiwan Makay is an institution with experience in weight control, noting that weight loss can lead to reduced blood cholesterol levels>\",2\r\n3268,ARTERIAL PLAQUE,,2\r\n3267,LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR,Lipoprotein receptors on cell surfaces interact with lipoproteins to regulate cholesterol metabolism>,2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2726,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,CHOLESTEROL,\"**ATHEROSCLEROSIS and CHOLESTEROL**  \n\nAtherosclerosis is a cardiovascular condition characterized by the buildup of plaque in the arteries, which can lead to reduced blood flow and increased risk of heart disease and stroke. Cholesterol plays a critical role in this process, with its effects varying depending on the type. High-density lipoprotein (HDL), often referred to as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol, helps prevent atherosclerosis by removing excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and transporting it to the liver for excretion. In contrast, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or \"\"bad\"\" cholesterol, contributes to the development of atherosclerosis when present in excess. Elevated levels of LDL can lead to the accumulation of cholesterol in arterial walls, forming plaque and narrowing the arteries. Therefore, maintaining a balance between HDL and LDL cholesterol is essential in reducing the risk of atherosclerosis. Excess cholesterol, particularly LDL, is a key factor in the progression of this disease.  \n\nThis summary integrates both descriptions, clarifying the distinct roles of HDL and LDL cholesterol in either preventing or promoting atherosclerosis while emphasizing the importance of cholesterol management in cardiovascular health.\",79\r\n2749,LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CHOLESTEROL,LDL carries cholesterol into surrounding tissues,56\r\n2751,HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,CHOLESTEROL,HDL transports cholesterol from tissues back to the liver,56\r\n3170,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,FOAM CELLS,Foam cells are a hallmark of atherosclerotic plaque formation.,34\r\n3179,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,SMOOTH MUSCLE CELLS,Smooth muscle cells contribute to atherosclerotic plaque formation when stimulated by high lipid levels,34\r\n3180,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,MACROPHAGES,Macrophages contribute to atherosclerotic plaque formation when stimulated by high lipid levels,34\r\n3181,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,PLATELETS,Activated platelets release growth factors that contribute to arterial wall thickening and atherosclerosis,34\r\n3321,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,ARTERY,Atherosclerosis primarily affects arteries by forming plaques in their walls,34\r\n3322,ATHEROSCLEROSIS,BLOOD VESSEL,Atherosclerosis affects blood vessels throughout the body,34\r\n3281,TAIWAN MAKAY,PATIENT,Taiwan Makay provides weight management programs that help patients reduce cholesterol levels,22\r\n2829,LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,ARTERIAL PLAQUE,\"Low-density lipoprotein deposits cholesterol in artery walls, forming arterial plaques\",12\r\n2830,LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN,LIPOPROTEIN RECEPTOR,Low-density lipoprotein binds to lipoprotein receptors to deliver cholesterol to cells,12\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
