It serves as a standard diagnostic tool for various hypertension-related conditions, such as **white-coat hypertension**, **morning hypertension**, **nighttime hypertension**, and **masked hypertension** (隐蔽性高血压). ABPM helps identify abnormal blood pressure fluctuations, including irregularities in circadian rhythms, such as elevated nighttime or early-morning blood pressure. By providing automated, continuous measurements, ABPM enables healthcare providers to assess blood pressure patterns more accurately than isolated clinic readings, making it a critical tool in hypertension management and diagnosis.  \n\nThe method is particularly valuable for detecting conditions that may be missed in traditional office settings, such as **white-coat hypertension** (where blood pressure is elevated only in clinical environments) and **nighttime hypertension** (abnormally high blood pressure during sleep). Additionally, ABPM aids in evaluating **morning hypertension**, a risk factor for cardiovascular events. Its comprehensive 24-hour monitoring allows for a more precise assessment of blood pressure behavior, contributing to better-informed treatment decisions.  \n\n(Note: The Chinese description provided—\"\"动态血压监测有助于发现异常血压波动、夜间或清晨高血压等血压节律失常，评估白大衣性高血压和隐蔽性高血压\"\"—has been incorporated into the summary, reinforcing ABPM's role in detecting blood pressure rhythm abnormalities and specific hypertension subtypes.)\",19\n943,WHITE-COAT HYPERTENSION,,2\n953,NOCTURNAL BLOOD PRESSURE,Nocturnal blood pressure refers to nighttime blood pressure patterns that help assess cardiovascular risk,2\n1435,持续性高血压,持续性高血压（Persistent Hypertension）是一种血压持续升高的病症，其特征是在所有环境下（如医院和日常生活中的不同场景）血压均保持较高水平。与白大衣高血压（仅在医疗环境中血压升高）不同，持续性高血压与更高的心血管疾病风险相关。这一病症需要长期监测和管理，以降低潜在的并发症风险。,2\n938,中国动态血压监测指南,\"The 'Chinese Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Guidelines' provide detailed methods for ABPM, standardizing its clinical application and promoting its use in community health centers.\"\"\",1\n940,COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS,\"Healthcare facilities where ABPM is being implemented for standardized hypertension diagnosis and management\"\"\",1\n941,REMOTE DYNAMIC DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM,\"Technology platform enabling standardized ABPM analysis and reporting, facilitating clinical applications\"\"\",1\n1439,24HABPM,\"24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, a diagnostic method for detecting hypertension patterns\"\"\",1\n1447,动态血压,\"动态血压用于诊断隐蔽性高血压，包括单纯白天高血压和单纯夜间高血压\"\"\",1\n1448,家庭血压,\"家庭血压用于诊断隐蔽性高血压，包括日夜高血压、单纯清晨高血压、单纯夜间高血压和全天家庭高血压\"\"\",1\n1449,坎地沙坦,\"坎地沙坦是一种降压药物，用于降低诊室高血压发生率\"\"\",1\n1450,雷米普利,\"雷米普利是一种降压药物，用于降低诊室高血压发生率\"\"\",1\n1451,尼索地平,\"尼索地平是一种降压药物，可延缓蛋白尿、糖尿病肾病进展以及脑卒中的发生\"\"\",1\n1452,阿利沙坦,\"阿利沙坦是一种降压药物，用于隐蔽性高血压降压治疗保护靶器官临床试验\"\"\",1\n1455,高血压预防试验,,1\n1453,雷米普利预防高血压试验,\"雷米普利预防高血压试验研究降压治疗对正常高值血压者的效果\"\"\",1\n1454,隐蔽性高血压降压治疗保护靶器官临床试验,\"我国学者开展的临床试验，研究降压治疗对隐蔽性高血压患者靶器官的保护作用\"\"\",1\n957,LVMI,\"**LVMI (Left Ventricular Mass Index)** is a clinical measurement used to assess left ventricular mass relative to body size, primarily employed in the diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).

Together, these metrics play a critical role in the assessment and management of cardiovascular health.\",19\n1445,清晨高血压,血压晨峰,血压晨峰是清晨高血压的一种类型,18\n785,HBPM,WHITE-COAT HYPERTENSION,HBPM helps identify white-coat hypertension through home measurements,15\n787,HBPM,FAMILY BLOOD PRESSURE DATA ANALYSIS PLATFORM,The platform supports standardized HBPM data analysis,14\n1444,阿利沙坦酯,清晨高血压,阿利沙坦酯用于治疗隐蔽性高血压，可能对清晨高血压也有一定的治疗效果,14\n1446,清晨高血压,夜间和清晨持续性高血压,夜间和清晨持续性高血压是清晨高血压的一种类型,14\n1449,清晨高血压,亚洲人群,Morning hypertension is more prevalent in Asian populations compared to Europeans,14\n1450,清晨高血压,欧洲人群,European populations show lower prevalence of morning hypertension,14\n1451,清晨高血压,日本,Japanese studies show high prevalence of morning hypertension among treated patients,14\n1455,清晨高血压,颈动脉粥样硬化,Morning hypertension increases the relative risk of carotid atherosclerosis,14\n1456,清晨高血压,白蛋白尿,Controlling morning blood pressure can predict improvement in albuminuria,14\n1458,清晨高血压,冠状动脉事件,Elevated morning blood pressure increases the risk of coronary events,14\n1459,清晨高血压,肾功能恶化,Elevated morning blood pressure has the strongest predictive value for worsening renal function,14\n1493,老年高血压,冠心病,老年高血压与冠心病等不良心血管预后密切相关,14\n1488,65~79岁老年人,老年高血压,65~79岁老年人是老年高血压的主要人群之一,13\n1489,80岁及以上高龄老年人,老年高血压,80岁及以上高龄老年人是老年高血压的主要人群之一,13\n1490,并存多种共病或老年综合征患者,老年高血压,并存多种共病或老年综合征患者是老年高血压的特殊人群,13\n1497,老年高血压,我国31省市2012—2015高血压现状调查研究,该调查研究提供了老年高血压患病率、控制率等关键数据,13\n1498,老年高血压,白大衣现象,白大衣现象是需要排查的老年高血压诊断干扰因素,13\n1499,老年高血压,假性高血压,假性高血压是需要排查的老年高血压诊断干扰因素,13\n1414,白大衣性高血压,持续性高血压,\"**白大衣性高血压 (White Coat Hypertension)** and **持续性高血压 (Persistent Hypertension)** are two distinct but related conditions. White coat hypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure readings in clinical settings, often due to anxiety, while normal readings occur in other environments. If left untreated, white coat hypertension can progress to persistent hypertension, a more serious condition marked by consistently high blood pressure regardless of the setting. Compared to persistent hypertension, white coat hypertension carries a lower risk of cardiovascular complications.
