It is a key lipid parameter used in assessing cardiovascular risk, particularly in hypertensive patients and those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Elevated LDL-C levels contribute to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing the likelihood of CVD, making it a primary target for lipid-lowering therapies.  \n\nAs a critical factor in lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health, LDL-C is often monitored and managed through pharmacological interventions, with various drugs specifically designed to lower its levels. Its role in ASCVD and other cardiovascular conditions underscores its importance in clinical risk assessment and treatment strategies.  \n\nIn summary, LDL-C is a major cardiovascular risk factor, linked to arterial plaque formation and CVD, and is a central focus in preventive and therapeutic approaches to improve lipid profiles and reduce disease progression.\",21\r\n841,HDL-C,\"**HDL-C (High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol)** is a lipid parameter commonly referred to as \"\"good cholesterol\"\" due to its protective role in cardiovascular health. It functions by helping to remove other forms of cholesterol, such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL), from the bloodstream and arteries, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. HDL-C is routinely monitored as an important biomarker for assessing cardiovascular risk, particularly in hypertensive patients, where it may serve as an indicator of potential health complications. While it is generally associated with positive effects on heart health, its levels can also be evaluated as part of broader risk factor analyses. Overall, HDL-C plays a critical role in maintaining cardiovascular health by facilitating cholesterol clearance and mitigating arterial plaque buildup.\",5\r\n839,TC,\"**Summary of TC (Total Cholesterol):**  \n\nTC refers to Total Cholesterol, a key measure used in assessing lipid levels in the blood. It is an important biomarker for evaluating cardiovascular health, particularly as a risk factor in hypertensive patients. As a lipid parameter, TC is routinely monitored in clinical settings to assess an individual's risk of cardiovascular diseases. Elevated levels of TC are often associated with an increased likelihood of developing heart-related conditions, making it a critical component of lipid profiling and preventive healthcare.  \n\nThe term \"\"TC\"\" consistently denotes Total Cholesterol across all descriptions, emphasizing its role in cardiovascular risk assessment. While the phrasing varies slightly—such as \"\"lipid levels in the blood\"\" versus \"\"cardiovascular risk factor\"\"—the underlying meaning remains the same: TC is a standardized metric for evaluating cholesterol-related health risks. No contradictions exist among the provided descriptions, as they collectively reinforce TC's significance in medical diagnostics and preventive care.  \n\nIn summary, TC (Total Cholesterol) is a well-established clinical measurement used to gauge lipid metabolism and cardiovascular risk, particularly in populations with conditions like hypertension. Its consistent definition and application underscore its importance in both routine health screenings and specialized medical evaluations.\",4\r\n2050,PCSK9抑制剂,\"PCSK9抑制剂（PCSK9 inhibitors）是一类用于降胆固醇的药物，通常作为联合疗法的一部分。这类药物通过抑制前蛋白转化酶枯草溶菌素9（PCSK9）的活性，从而降低低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL-C）水平，适用于高胆固醇血症和心血管疾病的治疗。  \n\n目前已获批的PCSK9抑制剂包括单克隆抗体类药物，如依洛尤单抗（Evolocumab）和阿利西尤单抗（Alirocumab），以及托莱西单抗（Tocilizumab，注：此处可能存在名称混淆，托莱西单抗通常指IL-6受体拮抗剂，而非PCSK9抑制剂）。此外，小干扰RNA药物英克司兰（Inclisiran）也属于PCSK9靶向疗法，通过RNA干扰机制长效抑制PCSK9的合成，实现持久的降脂效果。  \n\nPCSK9抑制剂因其高效性和良好的安全性，成为他汀类药物不耐受或疗效不足患者的重要选择。未来，随着更多临床研究的开展，这类药物可能在心血管疾病预防和治疗中发挥更广泛的作用。  \n\n（注：若“托莱西单抗”确为PCSK9抑制剂，需核实正确名称；目前已知的PCSK9单抗主要为依洛尤单抗和阿利西尤单抗。）\",1\r\n3083,SMALL INTERFERING RNA DRUGS,Small interfering RNA drugs are a newer class of medications that target specific genes to lower cholesterol levels>,1\r\n2038,PCSK9 INHIBITOR,\"**PCSK9 Inhibitor**  \n\nPCSK9 inhibitors are a class of drugs primarily used to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in the blood. They achieve this by increasing the removal of LDL from the bloodstream, targeting the PCSK9 protein, which regulates LDL receptor degradation. These inhibitors are particularly effective in high-risk patients, such as those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), where aggressive LDL-C reduction is critical.  \n\nPCSK9 inhibitors are often prescribed in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies, such as statins, to enhance their efficacy, especially in cases of mixed hyperlipidemia or when statin therapy alone is insufficient. Their use is well-established in managing high-risk patients who require additional LDL-C reduction beyond what traditional therapies provide.  \n\nWhile the descriptions vary slightly in phrasing, they consistently emphasize the role of PCSK9 inhibitors in lowering LDL-C, their application in high-risk populations, and their frequent use alongside other treatments like statins. There are no significant contradictions in the provided descriptions, only complementary details reinforcing their therapeutic purpose and target patient groups.  \n\nIn summary, PCSK9 inhibitors are a specialized class of drugs designed to significantly reduce LDL-C levels, particularly in high-risk cardiovascular patients, often in combination with other lipid-modifying therapies for optimal outcomes.\",2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n532,LDL-C,HDL-C,\"**LDL-C and HDL-C** are both cholesterol markers used in cardiovascular risk assessment, but they play opposing roles in cardiovascular health. **LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol)**, often referred to as \"\"bad\"\" cholesterol, contributes to the buildup of plaque in arteries, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, **HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol)**, known as \"\"good\"\" cholesterol, helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream, transporting it to the liver for excretion, thereby reducing cardiovascular risk.  \n\nThese two lipid markers are routinely measured together to provide a comprehensive evaluation of an individual's lipid profile and overall cardiovascular health. While **LDL-C** is associated with higher cardiovascular risk when elevated, **HDL-C** is considered protective, with higher levels generally linked to better outcomes. Their opposing functions make them critical in assessing and managing heart disease risk, guiding interventions such as lifestyle changes or medication to optimize cholesterol levels.  \n\nIn summary, **LDL-C and HDL-C** serve as key indicators in cardiovascular risk assessment, with **LDL-C** promoting harmful plaque formation and **HDL-C** offering protective benefits by aiding cholesterol clearance. Monitoring both markers allows for a balanced understanding of an individual's lipid metabolism and cardiovascular health.\",26\r\n926,TC,LDL-C,\"**Summary of TC and LDL-C:**  \n\nTC (Total Cholesterol) and LDL-C (Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol) are both measures of cholesterol levels in the blood and are key lipid parameters used in cardiovascular risk assessment. TC represents the total amount of cholesterol present in the bloodstream, including LDL-C, HDL-C (High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol), and other lipid components. LDL-C, often referred to as \"\"bad cholesterol,\"\" is a specific subset of cholesterol that contributes to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases.  \n\nBoth TC and LDL-C are routinely monitored in clinical settings to evaluate an individual's lipid profile and assess their risk for conditions such as atherosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke. Elevated levels of either parameter may indicate a higher risk of cardiovascular complications, though LDL-C is often prioritized in treatment guidelines due to its direct association with arterial plaque formation. Together, these measurements provide a comprehensive view of an individual's cholesterol metabolism and overall cardiovascular health.\",25\r\n1362,LDL-C,PCSK9抑制剂,PCSK9 inhibitors are used when statins alone cannot achieve LDL-C targets,22\r\n2464,LDL-C,SMALL INTERFERING RNA DRUGS,Small interfering RNA drugs are used in combination with statins to further reduce LDL-C levels,22\r\n2498,PCSK9 INHIBITOR,STATINS,Statins and PCSK9 inhibitors are often combined to achieve LDL-C targets in mixed hyperlipidemia,16\r\n636,HDL-C,高血脂,HDL-C levels are inversely related to hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular risk,10\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
