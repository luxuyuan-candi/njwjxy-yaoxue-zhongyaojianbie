They are known to induce hypertension through multiple mechanisms, such as enhancing the effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), increasing vascular sensitivity to catecholamines, and promoting water and sodium retention. Due to these effects, glucocorticoid-induced hypertension may require treatment with antihypertensive medications, including diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCB), or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB).
