Core symptoms include emotional, physical, and cognitive disturbances such as fatigue, sleep disruptions, impaired social functioning, and, in severe cases, suicidal thoughts. The condition varies in intensity, classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on diagnostic criteria, and may present differently across age, gender, and cultural backgrounds.  \n\nDiagnosis involves a clinical evaluation to exclude other medical conditions, as there are no specific diagnostic methods. Depression often coexists with physical illnesses, with prevalence rates ranging from 9% to 33% depending on the underlying condition. Despite its high prevalence, treatment rates remain low, with fewer than 10% of patients receiving adequate care in many countries.  \n\nEffective management includes a combination of medication, lifestyle adjustments, and standardized treatment protocols to control symptoms, reduce relapse rates, and improve overall health outcomes. Early diagnosis and intervention are critical for better prognosis.

Depression is a key component of bipolar disorder, which is characterized by alternating episodes of depression and manic or hypomanic (elevated mood) states. While depression involves persistent sadness, low energy, and loss of interest in activities, bipolar disorder encompasses a broader spectrum of mood swings, including periods of abnormally high energy, impulsivity, or irritability during manic phases.  \n\nIt is critical to differentiate between the two, as depression alone does not include manic or hypomanic episodes, whereas bipolar disorder requires the presence of these elevated mood states for diagnosis. Misdiagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment, as bipolar disorder often requires mood stabilizers rather than antidepressants alone. Both conditions, however, share depressive symptoms, underscoring the importance of thorough clinical evaluation to ensure accurate diagnosis and management.  \n\nIn summary, while depression is a unipolar condition focused solely on low mood, bipolar disorder is a cyclical condition involving both depressive and manic/hypomanic phases.
