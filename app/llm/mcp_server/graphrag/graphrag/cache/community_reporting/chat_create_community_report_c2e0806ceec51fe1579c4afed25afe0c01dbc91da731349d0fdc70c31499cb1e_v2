It is a major focus of lipid management guidelines due to its strong association with elevated cholesterol levels and other metabolic risk factors. ASCVD is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide, underscoring the importance of preventive and therapeutic interventions.  \n\nPreventive measures for ASCVD include complete smoking cessation and avoidance of secondhand smoke exposure, as tobacco use significantly exacerbates disease progression. Additionally, lifestyle modifications such as dietary changes and regular physical activity are recommended, though exercise safety must be carefully evaluated in affected individuals due to the chronic nature of the disease and potential cardiovascular complications.  \n\nIn summary, ASCVD is a serious, chronic condition that requires comprehensive management, including lipid control, smoking avoidance, and tailored physical activity to mitigate risks and improve outcomes.\",3\r\n2407,高甘油三酯血症,高甘油三酯血症是一种血脂异常疾病，主要表现为血液中甘油三酯水平升高。该病症可通过生活方式干预进行控制，其中限制饮酒和调整饮食是关键措施。即使少量饮酒也可能导致甘油三酯水平进一步上升，因此患者需严格避免或减少酒精摄入。此外，由于高甘油三酯血症与脂肪代谢密切相关，患者还需严格控制日常饮食中的脂肪摄入量，以维持血脂平衡。综合来看，高甘油三酯血症的管理需要结合戒酒和低脂饮食等多项措施，以有效降低心血管疾病风险并改善整体健康状态。,2\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2079,动脉粥样硬化性心血管疾病,高脂血症,高脂血症是动脉粥样硬化性心血管疾病的重要风险因素,237\r\n2081,高甘油三酯血症,高脂血症,高甘油三酯血症是高脂血症的一种具体类型,236\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
