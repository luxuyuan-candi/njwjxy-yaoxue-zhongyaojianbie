They are also effective in treating coronary syndromes and heart failure, making them versatile in cardiovascular care. Among the various types, selective β1 blockers are often preferred for elderly patients due to their targeted action. Additionally, beta-blockers are considered a first-line treatment for hypertensive patients with elevated heart rates, as they help regulate both blood pressure and heart rate.  \n\nThis summary integrates all provided descriptions, highlighting the key therapeutic uses and considerations for beta-blockers without contradictions.\",9\n1879,HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY,\"**Hypertensive urgency** is a medical condition characterized by severely elevated blood pressure that does not involve acute or progressive target organ damage, distinguishing it from a hypertensive emergency. Unlike an emergency, it does not require immediate intervention but still necessitates careful monitoring and gradual blood pressure reduction, typically within 24–48 hours. The condition underscores the importance of timely but controlled management to prevent complications.\",7\n1494,Α RECEPTOR BLOCKER,\"The **Alpha Receptor Blocker (Α RECEPTOR BLOCKER)** is a class of medications primarily used to treat hypertension, including in subemergency cases for blood pressure control. These drugs are effective in managing high blood pressure but may also lead to orthostatic hypotension, particularly in elderly patients. By blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors, they help relax blood vessels, thereby reducing blood pressure. While beneficial for hypertension management, their use requires caution in older individuals due to the potential side effect of orthostatic hypotension.\",6\n1553,LOOP DIURETIC,\"**LOOP DIURETIC** is a class of diuretics primarily used in the management of heart failure, where they help reduce fluid overload by promoting diuresis. Additionally, loop diuretics are employed in hypertension subemergency cases to aid in blood pressure control. These medications function by inhibiting sodium and chloride reabsorption in the ascending loop of Henle in the kidneys, leading to increased urine output. Their dual utility in both heart failure and acute hypertensive scenarios highlights their importance in cardiovascular and renal therapeutics.\",7\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1363,Β RECEPTOR BLOCKER,HYPERTENSION,β receptor blockers are the first-line treatment for hypertensive patients with increased heart rate.,192\n2176,CCB,HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY,Calcium channel blockers are used for hypertensive urgency management,58\n2185,Α RECEPTOR BLOCKER,Β RECEPTOR BLOCKER,Both Alpha and Beta receptor blockers are classes of medications used for controlling blood pressure in hypertension subemergency cases,15\n2190,LOOP DIURETIC,HYPERTENSIVE URGENCY,Loop diuretics are used for hypertensive urgency management,14\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
