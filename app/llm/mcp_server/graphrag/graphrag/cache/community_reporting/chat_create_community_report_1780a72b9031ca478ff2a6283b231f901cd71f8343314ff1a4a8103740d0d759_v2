While effective, TCAS are known to have significant anticholinergic effects, which can lead to dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, and cognitive impairment, particularly in elderly patients. Additionally, they carry a risk of cardiac toxicity, including arrhythmias and hypotension, making them generally unsuitable for older individuals or those with preexisting heart conditions.  \n\nDespite these limitations, TCAS remain a viable option for certain patients, especially when first-line treatments (such as SSRIs or SNRIs) are ineffective. Their use is carefully monitored to balance therapeutic benefits against potential adverse effects. Overall, TCAS represent an important but cautiously utilized tool in the management of depression, particularly in cases where alternative treatments have failed.\",6\r\n3538,NMPA,\"National Medical Products Administration, which provides safety classifications for antidepressant use during pregnancy\",3\r\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\r\n2932,TCAS,MAOIS,Both are traditional classes of antidepressants,10\r\n2958,NMPA,TCAS,NMPA provides safety classifications for TCAs during pregnancy,9\r\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
